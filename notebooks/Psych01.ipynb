The night was still very young, as it was around 22:00, when R and I thought: \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t we do some 2C-E again tonight, but this time without holding back?!\\u201d We had both used it before, but were hesitant and gradually increased the dose. Later, we heard that the dose should be consumed at once for the full effects to manifest. Otherwise it\\u2019s mostly the duration that increases. We both wanted to really go for it and consumed a line of approximately 20mg. I went first and instantly endured intense pain in my nose. It felt as if my cavities were chemically burning and I decided to lay down on a couch for a bit. When R noticed the tears in my eyes, a slight doubt appeared in his. Almost immediately afterwards, he jumped up, went straight for the mirror and took a dive into the deep with me, like a true friend! -WOOSH- While my nose was still sore, everything started to wave and the atmosphere got a bit grim. I didn\\u2019t feel at ease, walked outside and threw up, which somehow didn\\u2019t bother me whatsoever. Inside the caravan, I felt out of place anyway. The air was filled with cigarette smoke and it was very crowded. I was quite overwhelmed and thought: \\u201cLet\\u2019s take some speed, that should suppress most of the effects.\\u201d However, I was completely confused by the concept of a mirror and therefore had to ask a friend of mine to prepare it and even hold it at my nose. R and I decided to go for a walk towards our town. During the walk, I told him that I felt uneasy and that I was going home to sit the trip out in my quiet bedroom. He went back and I walked home. When I got there, I stood in front of my house, saw the lights were still on and thought to myself: \\u201cWhat the fuck am I doing?! I just consumed a drug of which I was eager to explore its potential, only to be going home right after that? Aside from that, how on earth am I going to explain my current state to my mother, who\\u2019s still up?\\u201d\",\n          \"T0:00-Tab is extremely bitter and tastes like gross chemicals. Extremely unpleasant. Makes my tongue very numb. T0:30-Starting to feel \\\"high\\\", feeling lightheaded and dazed. Slight visuals in the form of a barely noticeable colorful pattern overlayed on everything. T0:40-Feeling very \\\"high\\\". Visuals are still the same level, feel like I've just smoked a ton. Feeling lightheaded, elated, happy, dazed, and having the same strange thought processes that weed gives me. T0:45-Visuals starting to kick in harder. Things starting to breathe and vibrate. I feel like I'm vibrating and resonating with my surroundings. Even though I am in the dark, everything is very colorful. Any source of light has a rainbow halo around it. Everything light colored has a rainbow sheen. Dark objects begin to have blurry outlines and become very ambiguous in shape. Teeth grinding starts to kick in so I chew some gum. T0:50-Visuals reaching full force. Fractals begin to fill my vision and overlay everything. Every dark or uniform area of my room becomes filled with swirling fractals and mirrored repeating shapes. Tracers are very evident with every movement. Objects begin to change proportions, breathing, stretching, vibrating, warping, and swirling. My body feels like its being rocked back and forth like its on a boat. There is an owl made of fractals on my ceiling, staring down at me. THe rest of my ceiling has taken a grid shape that extends into infinity, each square of the grid filled with flashing spiraling shapes. Beams of light crisscross my ceiling, and random flashes of light are in the corners of my vision. These fractals don't feel \\\"organic\\\" but rather much mroe synthetic, with sharper angles and edges. My computer screen has fucked up proportions, with text warping and swirling, and all white space being filled with pulsating rings of rainbow colors. T0:55-Huge flashing ghost images begin appearing all over my field of view. They look like rainbow colored holograms. Most notably are giant flying insects-hornets and wasps and beetles. They make me feel really happy and are flying in circles all around my room. These soon get replaced by huge armored figures standing in my room. THey are wearing impractically huge fantasy armor with lots of spikes and bells and whistles, stoically standing there and watching me. They aren't vivid or realistically colored, but rather are translucent and rainbow colored. Ghost images follow everything I look it, blurring my vision, but they eventually dissolve into spiraling swirling fractals and flashing colors. Very interesting effect. The breathing of everything gets more intense. I can literally feel my room breathing, I can feel hot moist breath on me. I feel very sweaty. The walls are breathing in and out. My room is a living thing and I am inside of it. T1:00-My bedsheets have circles on them (not in this state, I mean that's the design on them). Looking at them, there are detailed human faces in each circle, each one looks hostile and is staring at me in some sort of unhappy manner. I don't really mind though, and I glare back at them. My computer keys are all changing in size and shape. The keyboard is lit up and rainbows are spiraling out of the light of each key, making typing hard but fascinating. Very little body load, extremely visual. Still feel like I'm on a boat/in a breathing entity. I try to stand up and realize I can't feel my legs. They feel cold and numb, but not like frozen numb, just numb like I've been sitting on them for a while. Walking is hard and I am having a hard time balancing. I sit back down, and feel immensely heavy. I feel like my insides are sloshing around like I am a water balloon. This wears off rather quickly though. T1:10-I start to look at my mineral collection. They are all beautiful and emitting rainbows. The crystals are all mirrored and breathing and pulsating rainbows and fractals. I decide to get off my computer for about 15 minutes to really sink into the trip. I stand up and lie on my bed and stare at my ceiling and blast some music. Lights that look like comets and amorphous blobs blast across my ceiling and dance to the music. Spiraling flashing fractals extend into infinity as my ceiling becomes a field of various color and shapes. In front of this are a bunch of wasps and dragonflies flying around. I curl up like a dead bug and feel my limbs go numb. Am I dying? Doesn't matter, the world looks cool. I can see the room starting to fold up on itself, withering like me, the insects become more agitated and fly around faster. I unfold my limbs and feeling rushes back. The fractals in my ceiling become more colorful and begin to flash more excitedly and the insects fade away. I stand up and return to the computer. T1:20-I'm starting to feel very hot and sweaty. It feels like a large warm wet animal is draped over me. I stand in front of my ac for a bit and feel the tingling cold breeze on my skin and it goes away. At this point I feel extremely happy and optimistic and have an elated sense of self worth, believing myself to be some sage or philosopher or some shit. I begin lecturing people on the internet about the power of positive thinking and happiness and I honestly can do nothing but smile. Things are still flashing and making ghost images and such. I've taken to just making inane observations and shouting them at people like they are grand epiphanies. T1:30-I try playing Chivalry:Medieval warfare. It's extremely difficult. I give up pretty quickly. T1:35-Visuals aren't as overwhelming anymore but are strong and consistent. There is really nothing new to report. For the next few hours, I am in pretty much the same state. The visuals are all the same and are of the same strength, as are the though processes and feeling of being high. Same fractals, same breathing, same vibrating, same pulsating, same lights and flashes and colors. T2:20-I decide to go to the bathroom to get my cat. The bathroom tiles are all look like mirror images of themselves and are breathing and pulsing colors and faces which was pretty cool. Being in a new environment was nice and changed the nature of the hallucinations. I grab my cat and return to my room. He is soft and his fur is swirling and warping. I go on webcam with someone. my face is warping and shifting in proportions, like I'm looking at myself in a funhouse mirror. T3:30-The peak is coming to an end. The visuals are becoming milder but I am in the same mental state. Nothing really special to note. T5:00-Starting to pick up again oddly enough. The clouds outside are forming into clumps of letters, but I can't read them. Things are still breathing and swirling and warping, no more colors or fractals though. T7:00-Clouds are beginning to return to normal, warping and swirling and shifts in proportion slowing down too. I try to sleep, its hopeless. Teeth grinding is very strong at this point and very annoying, as is the sweating. T8:00-Finally manage to fall asleep. Trip can be considered officially over. Submitted by - Nervewing\",\n          \"Today was the most intense day of my life. It was the greatest and most beautiful experience I have ever had. I was so happy I cried many times. I have never felt so at peace. I have never felt so happy. I have never felt so small and big at the same time. LSD feels like a giant contradiction. It feels like yin and yang. Today I had my second experience with LSD. I took around 300 \\u03bcg of LSD at 9 AM this morning. The LSD was tested using Ehrlich's reagent test and obtained from a reliable seller. Last week, I had tested 150\\u03bcg with underwhelming results. I was ready for an intense trip this time. I have tripped on shrooms/4-aco-dmt at least 15 times now and am fairly comfortable with psychedelic effects. During my trip, I felt like I had 1000x more control of my body and mind than I do sober. I could have multiple streams of thought / conversations going on at the same time and there was no confusion. At least five commentaries were going on at all times during my entire trip (except during the peaks where crazier shit was happening). These commentaries changed based on environmental factors. It felt as though \\\"the LSD\\\" had a fantastic sense of humor. It made complex and complicated jokes for me. It cracked me up. I was so amused and impressed at the cleverness and power of this drug. So many incredible thoughts and feelings happened during the trip, but I can't translate them into English. This trip report contains less than 5% of what I experienced. The trip lasted for twelve hours and I was having trippy/intense thoughts and feelings constantly throughout. Many moments felt timeless simply because I was experiencing so much so fast. I felt feelings that I have never felt before. I'm cannot yet describe what happened in English, but I imagine it will get easier with time. In this report, I am just going to describe what I can remember of the most important events. I am not even going to attempt to describe the visuals -- you can view them on the blog I linked you. I don't really pay much attention to the visuals while I am tripping. I pay much more attention to the mental effects, though I do enjoy the visuals and find that they add something special to the experience. After putting the two tabs under my tongue, I cleaned my room until I felt like I could no longer ignore the effects. The come up was very fast and caused no nausea unlike mushrooms. I decide to take a shower because I love peaking while in a relaxing setting. I felt a complete lack of anxiety by this point which lasted throughout the entire trip. I decide I want to try to go as far as I can go so I smoke sativa hash oil (always intensifies the trip for me and causes me to peak quicker). I write: --- 10:13 smoked weed heading to shower blast off :) --- I wish I had more timestamps after this, but I didn't have a good grasp of what the numbers on the clock meant and why they would be so important to me until five hours after taking the LSD. FIRST PEAK: This is the most intense part and I hardly remember any of it! It felt like something crazy was going to happen and the LSD was slowly easing me into this so I would be as comfortable as possible. I started peaking in the shower. My thoughts got crazy and then everything got so intense that I had to sit down. I had close eye visuals of visually impossible patterns or optical illusions. Everything felt so fucking trippy and I was loving every second of it. My thoughts start heading towards ego death. I start having regrets, thinking I am not so sure I am ready after all, but then I realize this is something that no human being can ever be ready for and I decide it's now or never and I realize I have never been more ready in my life. I begin to go into different trances where I am given knowledge that is felt as a \\\"truth.\\\" After I come down from the trances, I am only able to remember specific keywords. As the experience is not translatable to English, I can only try my best. Here is what happened: I feel like time has stopped completely. I let the hot water rain onto my face while sitting down in the shower and tried to relax and let my ego die but it was such a strange feeling. This was the only point I ever felt overwhelmed during the trip as I didn't know how far I was going to go at this point, but it was only for a split second. My face hits the hottest part of the shower water and the sudden heat reminds me of the idea of hell. I hesitate as I catch a glimpse into what I imagine ego death to be. I can no longer feel my body and I feel like I\\u2019m starting to fall straight into hell and I am aware that this drug could bring me to hell as it has brought others to hell and it would be more real and longer lasting than anything I have ever experienced sober. But then I realize that ego death means the end of myself which means there can be no fear. And then I\\u2019m not scared of death at all anymore and realize I never would be again and I try to let go. I remember thinking \\\"would I be so scared of ego death if the overwhelming feeling I feel right now was replaced with feelings of peace and happiness?\\\" I decided that I wouldn't be scared at all so I stopped being afraid. The fact that I hesitated for a second, but decided to attempt ego death anyway, was very important part of the trip. I am back with my body at this point, but I still want ego death. Everything is a bit confusing, but I have a feeling that I will have more control next time. So I sit and close my eyes and attempt to switch points of view with a random drop of shower water just to see if that could send me into ego death. Something weird/hilarious happens when I try to do this and I start cracking up. And then it felt like I died and was born and my birth was the beginning of the universe and then I got another glimpse into complete ego death (sorry, I can't describe this yet, I barely remember and I can only remember specific keywords!! I'll try to describe it better next time). It was a completely different level and it was so intense that I hesitated again. I begin to enter into some kind of dreamlike vision that is a total different level of tripping than I am used to. I was going to BECOME the vision. I had no body. The vision starts out in ancient Egypt. I was so certain at the time that it was Egypt! I felt like I was beginning to live the life of an Egyptian girl from the past, but it was only for a split second then I am brought back into my physical body. I felt that by starting to show me this, lsd was trying to teach me a lesson or tell me a mystical, religious, or spiritual story. It was a feature of the lsd. I got the feeling that the vision was going to be about how religion came about, but I have no proof of this as I never finished or even began the vision because I hesitated for a second time when I stopped feeling my body. Because I hesitated, I was not able to go any farther into the vision. I experienced another delusional \\\"truth\\\" that either because I hesitated twice when I tried to go into complete ego death or because of random chance or both, I was going to chase after ego death the entire trip and never reach it but I had to try anyways (so much more complicated than this though). This was an extremely euphoric moment and I didn't mind that I had to chase ego death as I was still having a fantastic trip already and the intensity level was perfect. I had to chase after ego death so that I knew that I really wanted ego death so that I could go deeper. After I stop peaking, I get out of the shower and go back to my room to get dressed. I decide to take a walk on State Street while I wait for my next peak. I had extremely profound thoughts and the removal of the cultural filter. I can't even begin to explain what I felt or thought, but it was the greatest walk of my life. I never feel confused on acid like I sometimes do on shrooms. With mushrooms, you are the passenger, but with LSD you are the driver. While walking down State Street I felt like I was an alien learning how to be human again. I felt like an alien being welcomed into a strange new land and then I realized that this land was not so alien after all! It was built just for me! And I had created it! It was all mine! I was so happy! After walking down State Street a few times, I have a delusion that today is the day that either I die and am reborn or I almost die and am almost reborn but miss it. I realize that I am starting to peak upwards again and decide to head to my house to peak in the shower and attempt to kill my ego again to prove to myself that this is what I want. (I didn't realize that both delusional truth scenarios had ALREADY happened until my ego started coming back after the third peak haaha! I love lsd. ) SECOND PEAK: Not really sure what happened here. I was in the shower and I attempted ego death again just because I felt like I had to go in a loop \\\"outside, shower, outside, shower, outside, shower\\\" and repeat it throughout the trip just to prove to myself that I really wanted ego death. It felt like this was the way the trip was supposed to go because I was chasing ego death but had missed my chance because I hesitated twice. It was not a negative loop or anything, just a loop I decided to go with because it amused me and I knew that LSD loves loops. I close my eyes, meditate, and attempt to breakthrough to the other side of ego death and nothing happens, but I am so fucking proud of myself for attempting. I get out of the shower, get dressed, and go outside and listen to music. I had a fantastic walk on State Street. When I feel myself peaking upwards again, I head to my house. I see one of my extroverted housemates Staci and converse with her for a minute instead of ignoring her like I would have sober. I don't want to make conversation for long though as she starts getting depressing so I just tell her that I\\u2019m peaking on acid and need to lie down or get in the shower and she wishes me a good trip. So I go back into the shower, attempting ego death again. I close my eyes, sit down, and try to meditate, but I realize that I'm not going to get anywhere. This doesn't bother me at all, as I experience a delusional \\\"truth\\\" that me going back to ego death during this trip was a very rare possibility as I had missed my chance when I had hesitated twice during my first peak but it was also because of random chance and math that had already been calculated. I had known this from the very start of the trip as a \\\"truth\\\" yet I still felt like I had to at least attempt ego death as to go along with the way the trip was supposed to happen. A few minutes pass. I assume the third peak is finished as I can feel myself coming down. I admit defeat -- ego death was not going to happen today. I missed my chance at ego death this trip because I hesitated twice, but, I am still completely satisfied with the trip intensity and so proud of myself for attempting anyways! I get out of the shower and start walking towards my room. While on my way to my room, I realize that I had forgotten to brush my teeth. I head back into the shower to brush them. And then LSD surprises THE ABSOLUTE FUCK OUT OF ME. As soon as I step back into the shower I start PEAKING ABSOLUTE BALLS. It was FUCKING RIDICULOUS because I was simply not expecting it at all. I thought I had already gone through the third peak and was coming down now. I thought my trip had ended. I had admitted defeat, already admitted to myself that ego death was simply not going to happen this trip -- I had had my chance and had hesitated twice and I would have to try again next time I dosed and that was perfectly alright with me. I was just trying to brush my teeth! THIRD PEAK: This was the happiest moment of my life. To quote Disregard Everything I Say, \\\"the feelings of profundity become so intense and profound that it becomes manifested as the feeling that you\\u2019re entire life has been building up to this single point and that the present moment has historical significance for all of humanity as nothing will ever be the same again.\\\" I felt this exactly. I go into a \\\"truth\\\" where I discover that LSD and other psychedelics are \\\"internally embedded, chemically induced religions that have existed within human beings all along\\\". At some points, it felt like LSD was a gift from some higher power - god, some programmer, myself, and/or all of the above. At other points, it felt like evolution was completely responsible for this. I experienced multiple points of view and could look at LSD from many different angles. This \\\"truth\\\" EXCITED THE FUCK OUT OF ME. I WAS GEEKING THE FUCK OUT COMPLETELY. I was like \\\"holy shit holy shit holy shit oh my fucking god asfsfsfasdfas\\\" the entire time. I thought of Shulgin and Hoffman at some points. I came to the conclusion that psychedelics have made a much bigger impact on human society, history, and religion than I had ever thought possible. Humans have been tripping balls for centuries and it is only nowadays that this is frowned upon by society. This peak was the most euphoric and happiest part of the entire trip. It felt like the \\\"grand finale\\\" of the trip. I clapped when the LSD was done showing off. I also remember bursting into tears of relief and happiness at some points of the peak. So intense. Looking back, I felt EXACTLY like this paragraph by Alexander Shulgin in Pihkal: \\\"I am completely convinced that there is a wealth of information built into us, with miles of intuitive knowledge tucked away in the genetic material of every one of our cells. Something akin to a library containing uncountable reference volumes, but without some means of access, there is no way to even begin to guess at the extent of quality of what is there. The psychedelic drugs allow exploration of this interior world, and insights into its nature. Our generation is the first ever to have made the search for self-awareness a crime, if it is done with the use of plants or chemical compounds as the means of opening the psychic doors. But the urge to become aware is always present, and it increases in intensity as one grows older. This is the search that has been a part of human life from the very first moments of consciousness. The knowledge of his own mortality, knowledge which places him apart from his fellow animals, is what gives Man the right, the license, to explore the nature of his own soul and spirit, to discover what he can about the components of the human psyche. How is it then, that the leaders of our society have seen fit to try to eliminate this one very important means of learning and self-discovery, this means which has been used, respected, and honored for thousands of years, in every human culture of which we have a record? Why has peyote, for instance, which has served for centuries as a means by which a person may open his soul to an experience of God, been classified by our government as a Schedule I material, along with cocaine, heroin, and PCP? ... Part of the answer may lie in an increasing trend in our culture towards both paternalism (authorities supply need and thus are able to dictate conduct) and provincialism (a narrowness of outlook, a single code of ethics)... The government and the Church decided that psychedelic drugs were dangerous to society and with the help of the press, it was made clear that this was the way to social chaos and spiritual disaster. What was unstated, of course, was the oldest rule of all: Thou shalt not oppose nor embarrass those in power without being punished.\\\" After the peak is over, I head out of the shower and back into my room. I am still tripping out hardcore about what just happened to me. I try to communicate what just happened in human English. I manage to type this: --- OH MY FUCKING GOD WHY THE FUCK IS THERE A SOME KIUDDRELIGIOUS KEY (LSD) IN OURSELVES? Why the fuc is theresomeweirfd religious/spirtuiual keyin side LSD>???? 2:13 --- This took a ridiculous time to type out and I had to hit the backspace button multiple times. It felt like my fingers were too big for the keyboard buttons. The words written on the screen didn't look English. I didn't know how to form sentences. I didn't know what words go before others so I just tried to get them all on there, but soon I realized it was pointless. I can't translate what had happened to me. I had gotten the keywords down, that would be enough. I finally grasped the importance of time stamps, but still don't know what time actually was. I'm geeking out and can't stop pacing around my room with rapid cycling thoughts. Fifteen minutes later, I finally have my thoughts together and type: --- 2:34 PM things make more sense but I still don\\u2019t know why there is a religious key inside of us, quote from pihkal --- At this point, I am five or six hours into my trip. My mind has never felt this clear. I felt more sober than sober. I had knowledge of all things. I still had my long-term memory, but it was pointless to think of anything stored in my long-term memory because I was having the most profound thoughts of my life. I can't even describe them... because the thoughts were lost after I transitioned from feeling everything to being human. I go outside. And then it hit me as a \\\"truth\\\" that the first five hours of the trip was my ego dying. I had experienced ego death without even realizing it. Hilarious. Now I was everything in the form of a nineteen year old girl and the next 7 hours would be me going from being everything back into human form. I realized that I had just experienced my birth which was also the birth of the universe and I think to myself \\\"this was the greatest day of my life.\\\" Extreme happiness right here and it stayed for the rest of the trip. I laughed about today being my birthday -- my actual day of birth. It seemed much more appropriate to call today my birthday than call July 27th my birthday. I wanted so badly for others to experience what I had felt. This was, I feel, the ULTIMATE HUMAN EXPERIENCE. It was the greatest day of my life and the greatest thing I have ever done. I truly felt \\\"at peace\\\" with myself and everything. Unfortunately, I felt like there were few human beings healthy enough to handle these chemicals without going crazy because of our society. I remember thinking during the trip that there is a very thin line between tripping and crazy in our current society and that most human beings would not be able to handle what I had just gone through without freaking the fuck out. I wanted to convince my brother to try LSD, though, because he is the only person I know who would probably be able to handle the intensity level. At one point in my trip notes, I wrote: --- TELL BROTHER TO EXPLORE LSD AND SHROOMS DEEPER TELL MY BROTHER THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THERE THAT I WANT HIM TO SEE --- It was the happiest day of my life, but the fact that most human beings would never experience what I had just experienced made me so sad. I figured if I called my brother right now, it might start a chain reaction that would lead up to him taking LSD and experiencing the greatest day of his life too. I was worried that when I sobered up I would never get the courage to start this chain reaction, so I decided to call him right now during my acid trip to leave a big impression. I wasn't anxious about calling, but I wasn't sure if I could make conversation, so I had to write what my message was on a piece of paper before I made the call. I wrote down \\\"Have you ever considered doing lsd? I just had the greatest day of my life. I have never been happier! You need to try this! I am going to buy you lsd. You're going to love it!\\\" I figured this was enough conversation material to get the ball rolling and to get my point across. After this, it was up to him to start researching the effects of the drug in depth and start preparing his mind. The next 7 hours were complete euphoria. I walked for eight hours straight stopping only for food, water, and weed to smoke to intensify the experience. Over the next seven hours, I walked down State Street, listened to Phish and the Flaming Lips, thought a lot, and learned what it was like to once again feel like a human being. This trip awakened the love of science in me.

This was my 7th day back from the break. I didn\\u2019t have a whole lot of weed. Enough for 4 or 5 decent sized bowls. Probably smoked 1.5 grams in total. I had the intention of getting very high. I really enjoy psychedelic drugs, and recently saw a post about turning cannabis into a psychedelic by focusing your mind. Throughout the session, I continued to tell myself to get higher. I affirmed it in my brain. I said \\u201cYou will get so high, you will be overwhelmed\\u201d. I\\u2019d heard that you can get higher by just taking bigger hits, so I took a huge hit off a glass spoon pipe.Waited. Packed a fat bong and took massive rips. Waited. Vaped a bowl off the arizer, all the while maintaining this \\u201cget high as fuck\\u201d mindset. Well, I began climbing the ladder. I went from happily buzzed, to nice and stoned, to quite stoned, to really high. From really high (probably [7]) I know if I\\u2019m getting super stoned if I get a sort of 3D clear edge effect. I didn\\u2019t get that at all. I sat at a [7] for around 4 minutes or so, mildly disappointed that I couldn\\u2019t get higher. Either weed or my body acknowledged my disappointment, and suddenly I was skyrocketed. I began to see a large God-like figure in the corner of my vision. I assumed it was God. The being had a zooming like feature to it. Psychonaut wiki\\u2019s definition describes it perfectly. \\u201c Images can switch between each other via the experience of one's vision zooming into or out from the current image to such an extent that it reveals an entirely new image.\\u201d The God-like figure seemed to come from within me. Finally, after being fascinated by this God-like figure, I began to realize who it was. It was Zeus! He had grey hair, and bright orange eyes (I smoked tangerine strain..Maybe that had something to with the color?). This being looked similar to something that my friend and I had seen in a park many years. Some being with grey hair and orange eyes was crouched beside a small brick building in a park. We we\\u2019re on the swings and both acknowledged it\\u2019s existence..and proceeded to run like hell. Zeus was a very large humanoid figure. He was against a darker background, emphasizing his existence all the much more. This lasted for around 5-10 minutes of him coming from inside me and staring somewhat judgmentally at me. During this time, I had an INTENSE body buzz. I could hardly move. My eyes felt incredibly heavy, and hurt to look at the computer screen. I rested my head on my desk and closed my eyes looking at the floor. Eventually, the heaviness faded, as did Zeus. He was no longer coming in and out of my vision, though his orange eyes often stared into me from my peripheral vision of my left eye. IT seemed as if he wasn\\u2019t happy that I wasn\\u2019t leaving. He seemed to have something to tell me, and due to my lack of weed, I wouldn\\u2019t be able to hear it. Submitted by Wispy\",\n          \"First, some important background information. I had only started smoking cannabis 3-4 months before this experience. My cannabis use was uncontrolled and was a minor problem. My heavy use was ended when the police searched my dorm room. I have been diagnosed with ADHD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The cannabis certainly helped with the anxiety, but having to stop for drug tests and getting in trouble with the law and the school really did not help. I had been interested in psychedelics prior to this event and had tried 25b once before. I also took LSD twice and then mushrooms once before this Ayahuasca experience. I had a friend at this time (B) that had separation anxiety and addiction issues. He could not stand to be alone for one second. He demanded that I brought him along and made a separate dose for him. Not wanting to hurt his feelings, I agreed to do this. I had hoped that it would help open his eyes. He did not care what the effects of the drug were, he just wanted to get high. When I had a free couple of days, I decided to do it, thinking I had researched enough and was prepared. When the brew was prepared, my friend and I met at a set of tables spaced appropriately from any buildings so smokers could sit and smoke. These tables were fairly popular among many drug users as a hangout spot. I decided to make the Ayahuasca Milkshake. We ate the seeds, then 15-25 minutes later, we began drinking the milkshake. The taste and smell was horrendous. It was quite difficult to get down. I believe if i had put more bananas in it that it would have been somewhat easier. When we were done we just sat around. A crowd started accumulating; it's easy to get people out there just by sitting there. My set and setting were both bad. I was worried about the legal issues, annoyed that my \\\"friend\\\" was there. There was someone there who was not a drug user and just wanted to see something bad happen to us. He continuously made non-helpful remarks like \\\"Oh I'm having so much fun\\\" and then pretending to vomit. Eventually I began to feel a little light headed and extremely nauseous. It was difficult to process what was going on in my field of vision, fairly intensely decreased Visual Acuity and Visual Haze. I felt like I was only half-conscious: maybe this could be categorized as Thought Deceleration. I sat down for a few seconds and, in attempt to seem like I was okay, asked some people what they were doing. As soon as the question left my mouth, A wave of blackness overcame me (Consciousness disconnection?). It was as if I blinked and let my muscles relax, no convulsions. As soon as I opened my eyes again, everyone was looking at me. Some said I just had a seizure. The one who was not a drug user but was probably the most intelligent and most medically knowledgeable said that it was not. I don't believe it was a seizure, just the power of the brew kicking in rapidly (Loss of Motor Control). I needed to lay down. Another friend said that I could rest in his room. I began to walk with him towards his dorm, but soon after standing up, another wave of darkness hit me. Whatever my eyes were focused on I could see just fine, but around the edges of my vision were kaleidoscoping black triangles. I had no sense of what was going on, but people we're holding me up, guiding me to my friend's room. I was not thinking anything. It was very dreamlike. I thought that, when I lost muscle control, I had soiled myself. When I got into the elevator, there was a sorority girl in there. She looked at me and said something about drinking, to which my fellow table-goers agreed was the problem (although they knew it was not). I decided that it would be a good idea to tell her that I thought I soiled myself. I blanked out again and found myself on the bed when I opened my eyes again. I needed to check if I was correct about the bladder problem, so I asked for help getting to the bathroom. It turns out that I had not, but when I got out of the stall, I found I could walk around again just fine. If I had been capable of any thought at that time, I would have known I was dying. B was still sitting outside at the table, just staring off into space. After resting on the bed for a bit, just feeling embarrassed and lightheaded but not really tripping, I decided I would get out of my friend's hair and go lay in MY bed. Everyone was still concerned I would have another \\\"Seizure\\\" but I did not. I also could not throw up, although I wanted to. When I was alone in my room, laying down, I began to feel myself slipping off into something like non-existence. I think what I was experiencing was what dying feels like. It was almost physical. The shadows of the blinds on the ceiling seemed to go on forever. My thought patterns were looping very badly but I was slowly gaining more introspective insight. I also felt a very vague presence but I could not put my finger on it nor was there any kind of communication. After a while of this, the friend who let me lay in his room called me and told me that B made him call 911. This kicked my anxiety into overdrive, although that situation would probably do that to anyone. I immediately jumped out of bed, grabbed the ingredients for the brew and went to another dorm to throw them away in a trash chute. I found that suddenly I had thought acceleration instead of deceleration. I speed walked down to the table to try to locate B's room mate to tell him what happened and to suggest that he relocate his cannabis supplies. Then I went back to my room. On the way there I noticed that for quite some time I had been hearing a quiet screeching/buzzing/humming noise. Like a white noise made of screams. I was still nauseous but could not throw up. I just laid in my room waiting for it to end, waiting to fall asleep, feeling sure I was dying. When it was over I began to deeply question the nature of reality. Somewhere, maybe when I felt the other's presence, I felt another reality, so alien and unlike ours. I was scared to close my eyes because I thought that when I opened them I might find myself in another reality. I have developed an intense fear of my inevitable death. I also occasionally get mild dissociation. These effects are almost gone, 3 months later, although I doubt I can ever truly come to terms with my death (and I think most people can not). However, I became very motivated to do well in all areas of life. I am far more understanding of other people than I was. Far more open-minded, capable of seeing things from other's perspectives. I don't think the life-changing came from the feeling that I was dying but it was part of it. Some day I will try again in a good set and setting. Submitted by - Marwyn\",\n          \"After spending years thinking very fondly of DXM, I decided it was time to try another dissociative. I managed to order MXP and spent several hours finding a sweet spot via the Shulgin Method of starting very small and increasing dosage. By the time I reached approximately 75 mgs, I found myself feeling quite nice. My body felt warm and dry, and clean. I had expected something like DXM, but DXM has a much more liquid feel, oozy, whereas MXP felt like cloth. I recall feeling incredibly reckless, acting as strangely as I liked in front of my parents, which provoked them to ask what are you on, as they will. I told them nothing at all and fled to the basement. In the basement, I insufflated I would say 25 more mgs, and put on some music. It was music that I'd never heard before, just something I found on the 420chan dissociative discussion, a man playing guitar. I remember the music not only sounded incredible but felt very good to listen to, nearly orgasmic, in fact I was moaning out loud which provoked my dad to come down and investigate. Normally, I would be much much more cautious, but I'd like to stress that even at a low dose, the sort of dissociation that MXP provides you with may delete all worry/anxiety to a level that is actually dangerous. By the time my dad came downstairs, I was attempting to insufflate more and raise the dose, but was unable to, as he had removed the door from my bedroom earlier that week and therefore I had no privacy. He called the police and what followed is a gigantic debacle involving the police, the hospital (why?) and later the mental hospital but that's all ancient history. During this debacle however, I remember a growing warmth in my head, around the temples, and a wonderful sense of peace. I told the police officer, I feel GREAT, and actually tried to discuss the effects with him, which he had no interest in doing. Normally I have severe social anxiety, but I was able to do both this, and later on I recall telling the two nurses how pretty I thought their eyes were, and then comparing and contrasting their two pairs of eyes for them. I should note that even at this low dose there are spaces which I can't quite remember, or can't remember the order of, but this could also be attributed to DXM use earlier in the week. Also, at a certain point, I'm not sure where it falls on the timeline, I completely exploded, not physically exploded, MXP isn't that dangerous, but emotionally, yelling and screaming in a way that I'm intensely embarrassed about now, like a spoiled little girl. I would recommend MXP only for an environment void of high suspicions. In low doses, take it with a group of friends who know you are taking a drug. It would probably be very nice in combination with alcohol. I would personally like to combine it with cannabis to negate the anxiety and embarrassment cannabis usually lays on me. In high doses, because it's a dissociative, I'd recommend taking it in either an absolutely safe place in which you're virtually locked away, alone or with only one or two friends.
