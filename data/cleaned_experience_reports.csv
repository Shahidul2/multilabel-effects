Experience:1050 Âµg 1cP-LSD - The matrix,"After 1P-LSD and other LSD derivatives were prohibited in Germany, the answer of the RC branch was 1-Cyclopropionyl-d-lysergic acid diethylamide or short: 1cP-LSD. It was only a minor modification to 1P-LSD according to the manufacturer and is thought to be metabolized to LSD-25 in the body. But even if it is not metabolized, at least the effects are nearly identical in my opinion. In the course of the day, I prepared drinks and sweets, closed the shutters and put seven pellets with 150 μg 1cP-LSD each in my mouth, chewed them and let them get absorbed by the mucous membrane. After just a few minutes, the first visual effects began, the world started morphing, everything had a slight shine to it. I had to laugh, as I have not done for a long time. For probably half an hour I laughed on and on. Despite the fact that I felt familiar about this feeling, I could hardly stand the ongoing laughter fits.Suddenly a small light appeared in front of my eyes, I started observing it and it came closer and closer. I understood that this was a sign of the oncoming peak. I winced briefly and then it hit me. Ego death. I lost track of my identity. The table in front of me disappeared, my vision turned to black nothing and suddenly I could see the whole universe in my mind's eye. I fluctuated back and forth between a collective consciousness and my own ego based consciousness. I managed to turn on several frequencies sounds and could only sit in my chair from then on. I closed and opened my eyes repeatedly and could see 'the matrix' passing me by when they were shut. It consisted of spinning, transparent walls that reached to infinity. I can not really describe it, it was just was the whole load of geometry that reached into infinity. The feeling to be able to look into infinity was magnificent. I saw various particles, glimmering points, appearing and disappearing, moving back and forth and streaks of light that seemed to originate from other dimensions. The visual effects slowed down and when I opened my eyes, I could see reality almost as usual. But it did not take long, and I was pulled into a tunnel again and could observe spirals and geometric patterns that divided and repeated themselves over and over again. I can not tell how long I was in this state, but it was wonderful.The feeling when I arrived in our normal reality is indescribable, it was pleasantly warm, slow and it felt like I was just born. The colors were still enhanced and the world looked more beautiful than usual. Please be careful with high doses like this! It can easily turn into a bad trip and you can experience hell on earth. Only consume this substance if you are aware of all risks. All in all, I think 1cP-LSD is a suitable LSD substitute.

Experience:26mg - Stage 3 Trip,"Walking to a friends house, I popped a gel capsule pill containing 26mg of 4-AcO-DMT. By the time I had reached his house, I was extremely nauseous. I had to lie down for a good ten minutes, right about when my friend showed up. I started to notice some FOV distortion, a usual effect for me. I was now trying to set up a chrome cast to stream some music/video to, but my short-term memory and motor skills were already lacking. It felt very stoning. Once the TV was set up, we started streaming a new Psyched Substance video to it. This is when visual distortions became much more apparent. The person in the video appeared to almost be coming out of the screen, and the screen appeared increasingly kaleidoscopic. At this point, my second friend arrived at the house with a warm welcome. The geometry of the room no longer appeared cuboid, and distance seemed to constantly change. By now, things were starting to get really intense. Intense synesthesia and sensory confusion ensued. About to ask my friend to play some trippy videos, I realized that the music was already just as visually stimulating. Looking up at the ceiling, I began to see curved, color changing patterns in the stucco. They moved and changed in front of me. Looking around me, my friends seemed to be incredibly vertically stretched, like in a circus mirror. Going on my phone, I started to play hacked Subway Surfer. The characters and environment seemed to move and change with the music. At one point, I perceived the character play the game in reverse. It was at around this point that I was hit with an overwhelming understanding of everything. I was semi-unaware of my own existence, occasionally realizing that I had memories, then playing them back in my head incredibly quickly. It felt as if my brain was in overdrive, analyzing everything that I had ever known. This slowly passed and I unknowingly began to come down. At around this time, my friend insisted we go outside, which was quite rewarding. Upon leaving the house, there were still obvious visuals, but walking through a forest path was perfect for the comedown, and helped me relax immensely.

Experience:26mg - I begged the shroom aliens to kill me,"I took 26mg of 4-aco-dmt alone in my bedroom at 8pm. I started coming up in about 10 minutes. In 20 minutes, I was extremely nauseous. I wanted to throw up badly, but I held it in uncomfortably because I didn’t want to throw up the drug before I was sure it was absorbed. I turned off all the lights in my room so that it was pitch black. I then lay down on my bed and closed my eyes. At 40 minutes in, everything started getting intense. Too intense. I got really scared because I was less than an hour in and already in way over my head. (When I usually trip, the peak happens exactly at three hours. I thought this trip was going to be the same, so I think this is why I freaked out.) I blasted off into hyperspace and it scared the absolute shit out of me. I tried as hard as I could to go with the flow and allow the shroom aliens to do what they wished with my brain chemicals in hyperspace, but I couldn’t stop being so terrified. It was so fucking overwhelming. I thought about taking my benzos about a hundred times. I wanted to go back to being human, but I knew that I would regret it if I did, so I didn’t. At some points, the shroom aliens were doing strange things to my brain chemicals and showing me things in hyperspace. At other points, I was trying to die in the desert so I wouldn’t be a scared human being in hyperspace anymore. I remember trying to die in the desert and thinking “how long do I have to keep dying for?” I tried to die at least a hundred times (only a couple times were in the desert). It really felt like I was dying. The entire trip was me trying to let go. I begged and prayed to the shroom gods to allow me to die so I could explore hyperspace without my scared human ego, but it never happened. Or at least I don’t think it did. I should have smoked weed – I think that would have gotten me there, but I was completely overwhelmed, so much that I couldn’t stand up. Time was moving incredibly slowly the entire time. I kept looking at the time and stopwatch on my phone, wondering when things would start making sense. It felt like all I had left of the human world was my ego and the time. I knew that I would return from hyperspace at the three hour mark and I was just counting down the seconds. I was also begging for the shroom aliens to just kill me and do whatever they wanted to me. I surrendered completely to them hundreds of times, but the terror just would not leave me. I was completely terrified, but I still managed to keep my mind together for the most part, and I knew the entire time that I could end it with a benzo. Eventually, around an hour and forty minutes, I had to get up to go to the bathroom. The shroom aliens allowed me to go to the bathroom and then when I returned I decided to keep the lights on. I lay down in my bed and then start thinking about what the fuck just happened to me and I start laughing for about five minutes straight. I remember that I have a voice recorder on my phone, so I turn it on and start recording my thoughts. I’m still tripping heavily, but I’m no longer in hyperspace.

Experience:25mg (insufflated) - Simultaneously amazing and horrible,"Sometimes people who should know better do stupid things. I knew the set and setting wasn't really right for playing with a new psychedelic, but I went ahead and did it anyway. Here's what was wrong with the set and setting: I'm getting over the flu I was on the tail end of a day spent stimmed on 4F-MPH I'd been awake for about 24 hours All of which I recognised as reasons not to trip, but I said ""fuck it"" and did it anyway. I wasn't being entirely irresponsible - I reagent tested, and allergy tested first, and I'm experienced enough with psychedelics that I thought I could deal with any weirdness that the less-than-ideal circumstances might cause. And while the dose I went for wasn't low, it wasn't ridiculously high either. So around 2 PM, I weighed out 25mg of 4-AcO-DMT and snorted it (the shorter duration reported for that route-of-administration being a nod towards sense and not pushing sleep deprivation too hard). Effects came on fast - but were initially fairly mild. Within five minutes there were a general swimminess to my vision. This developed into some characteristic tryptamine-style visuals - flowing colours, the walls of the room started to look like they were at odd angles. There wasn't much of a psychedelic headspace - the overall effect was pretty relaxing. I was actually more impressed with the closed-eye visuals which were interesting and quite different to the phenethylamine and ergoline CEV's I'm more experienced with. Rather than geometric or fractal forms, the CEV's were like sheets of abstract art, intersecting and morphing - it was all very pretty to look at, and I was content to lay in bed, listening to music and enjoying the show. The music itself was beautifully enhanced by the drug. Things picked up in intensity around an hour in. I started noticing some significant time dilation, particularly in the music. I mean this literally - it sounded slowed (though not shifted in pitch) to about half its actual speed. Some annoying body-load started to show up at the same time - enough nausea to be distracting and some weirdness around breathing. As I mentioned, I'm getting over the flu, and this means I've been coughing a lot. I think that laying down on my back combined with the physical effects of the 4-AcO-DMT was a bad idea because it ended up feeling like I couldn't breathe properly, a sensation that was only made worse by the time dilation, which made it feel like the time between breaths was getting longer and longer. Thinking it through at the time, I knew that my perceptions weren't in line with the actual reality of the situation, and I knew I was in no real danger, but the sensation was nevertheless fairly unpleasant. With the nausea worsening, I tried a small amount of vaped cannabis e-liquid to see if that would help. It did - briefly - but it also accelerated the intensity of the trip to an extreme level. It was impressive at first - the visuals were crazy and beautiful - not just patterns, but three-dimensional morphing surfaces covering everything, bright colours in purple, green and cyan (a palette of colours that was very familiar from previous experiences with Ayahuasca, interestingly). Around 1h 25m I noted that there was a bit of a body load, but it was definitely worth it. But the intensity and disorientation kept increasing and soon extended to some fairly intense somatic effects. Before long my sense of space was completely and utterly fucked - the usual three dimensions of space kept switching, which had the not entirely pleasant effect of making my body feel like it was folding through itself or turning inside out, or both at the same time. I don't think this was the cause of the increasingly intense nausea I was feeling, but I don't believe that it helped. And then I had a conversation with a cardboard box that's on top of my wardrobe. That was the form that the eternal spirit of the drug had decided to take and it looked like an Aztec god. I was suspicious of this - 4-AcO-DMT is a chemical, not mushrooms and I felt it was a bit much for the psychedelic spirit entity of a chemical that was invented in my own lifetime to assume the form of something much older with a much greater claim to authority. Either way, the psychedelic avatar of whatever seemed to feel that I hadn't approached it with enough respect and was irked by my refusal to acknowledge it as the powerful thing it claimed to be. I rolled my eyes at it and apologised, which seemed to appease it to some extent. Everything was getting a bit intense, but I was coping. I pulled my blanket up over my head and tried to maintain a sense of bodily integrity until things calmed down. This was actually by far the most fascinating part of an already interesting (in the sense of 'may you live in interesting times') trip. The blanket above my face was an infinitely detailed hyper-dimensional surface on which some other entities decided to come along and say hello to the monkey with a head full of way too much psychedelic drugs. They were friendly and curious and incredibly diverse in form, ranging from something that vaguely resembled a classic 'grey' alien with the huge eyes (that one felt a bit threatening, but I declined its offer of abduction and probing, and it lost interest when it was clear I wasn't going to go full-on out-of-body experience with it) to the completely abstract and rather lovely entity that reached out calming and gentle tendrils of energy towards me, which felt borderline erotic. They were all a bit too close to my face for this to really be that comfortable, but it was a truly extraordinary experience to go through. I'm not of the opinion that these things are 'real' in the sense of having an existence independent of the union of human and drug, but that certainly didn't detract from the hyper-reality of the experience for me. I pulled the blanket off of my face again. From my notes, I know that no more than 15 minutes had passed since the sudden increase in intensity had begun - it felt much, much longer than that. I was still feeling quite nauseous, and also, I needed to use the bathroom. The movement didn't make nausea any worse, but the brightness of the corridor and bathroom were almost overwhelming. I wondered if being sick would help with nausea, but it was clear that it wasn't going to happen by itself and I didn't feel up to the logistics of actually forcing it, so I returned to my bedroom. I was a bit wary of throwing more cannabis at the situation, but I was feeling more in control at this point and decided that I'd rather cope with increased intensity in exchange for alleviating nausea and this actually worked out fairly well. The overall feeling at this point was that I'd been poisoned, with something incredibly interesting and entertaining, but a poison all the same. It was a strange feeling - to be simultaneously having both an amazing and a horrible time. It felt like a high cost to pay regarding body load, but ultimately one that was worth the price of admission. Even as I noted the toxic feeling, I knew that given the opportunity I would try this again (though in circumstances less likely to lead to trouble). I'm glad I have as much experience with psychedelics as I do because without the cast iron certainty that I could cope and was going to feel okay again soon, it would have been very easy to freak out completely. It was challenging, but not terrifying, but only because I know how to navigate this territory. I'm pretty sure that without the resources I have to draw on, I'd have been a crying mess on my bathroom floor for most of the trip. Two and a half hours after I'd dosed and after alternately enduring and enjoying a full hour of completely off-the-charts intensity, I started to come down. The comparison was stark - I was still tripping hard, and things would remain visually intricate and impressive for another couple of hours, but the feeling of being poisoned was gone, and the spatial dimensions had returned to their normal places. I was online and processing the experience by talking about it and trying to work out what the fuck had happened. Had I screwed up my dose? Am I just sensitive to this chemical? Or had the combination of lingering flu symptoms and the other drugs potentiated it massively? I'm not sure. Visual effects lingered, and it was only 8 hours after dosing that I really felt back to baseline. It wasn't a bad trip, but it was definitely among the most challenging experiences I've had with psychedelic drugs and a reminder that sometimes throwing caution to the wind is not the best idea. But even so, it was an incredible experience, and while I'll try to learn the lesson to remember that right set and setting should not be disregarded quite so casually, I don't think I regret having done so on this occasion.","['3 dimensional textures', 'autonomous entities', 'drifting', 'increased music appreciation', 'internal hallucination', 'nausea', 'perspective distortions', 'sedation', 'spatial disorientation', 'tactile hallucination', 'time distortion']",1905
Experience:25mg - A labyrinth of organs and a storybook walk,"Me and my best friend are 18, the antisocial nerdy type. We smoked weed together twice last summer, and more recently we started to become interested in psychedelics. After doing our research, we ordered 100mg of 4-aco-dmt and a couple weeks later we met at his house to give it a try. We began with a threshold dose of ~5mg each, as an allergy test. I hardly felt anything, but he described prickly and ticklish sensations, acted goofy and fixated on details of his surroundings. Evidently he was more sensitive to it than me. We decided I would take 25 mg and he would take 15. Preparing for the trip, we mixed the powder into some warm water, cleaned up the room, and made a playlist of trippy videos. We decided that I would take my dose first, so he would be sober if something went wrong. I drank my share at 7:45, and curled up on the bed. By 8:15 I felt warmth and numbness throughout my body. At 8:33 the air from the ceiling fan began to tickle me all over, and I felt really giddy. Soon after it began to seem vaguely like the objects in my peripheral vision were creatures and faces, and my mind felt like it was broadening. The proper trip began fairly suddenly. We were watching psychedelic music videos when I was overcome with amazement and reverence for the community of people who made them. It felt like I was entering the source material, and I finally understood what these people were trying to convey. I was awestruck by a world of endless possibilities I never knew existed. My friend took his dose about an hour and a half after me, but as I entered the deepest part of my trip I couldn't focus on him. I was immersed in the music and visuals, and when I closed my eyes I felt like I was swimming through a formless but wonderful place, like a swirling gaseous planet. Everything felt jiggly and bouncy, as if I was surrounded by moving water balloons, the nonsense word ""jubbly"" came to mind. Eventually, I realized my friend was uncomfortable and a I gave him a turn on the bed. As I laid with pillows and blankets on the floor, my insides felt like they were churning. When I closed my eyes it felt like I was soaring through my own body, which felt like a network of visceral, underground tunnels. I fixated on the ideas of dirt and flesh, my hands looked like morphing blobs of clay. The churning sensation drove me to go to the restroom, even though I didn't actually have to. In the mirror and on the toilet, my body felt earthy, like I had lived in nature all my life. Eventually, me and my friend got antsy and decided to take a walk. Everything looked like classic Disney, the trees, the houses, even my friend's face. My friend said it felt like a different neighborhood. He looked up at the stars and froze up, he almost fell back in wonder. (Afterwards, he told me this was the peak of his experience, he felt like his brain activity went off the charts and it felt like his soul was rising from his body). He got a bit scared, grabbed my hand, and we hurried back to his house. We went through an alleyway and everything seemed too far apart. When we got to his driveway, he was amazed by his car, remarking at how beautiful it looked. he wanted to sit on the porch for a while, but I felt out of place, so we went inside. We ate some Doritos, which were incredibly vivid in taste, texture, and crunch. The experience was borderline synesthesia. After that, we played with his cat. The cat was adorable and we felt very strong empathy with it. We toyed with the idea of giving the cat a bit of the drug, but decided that it was his body, and that he was perfectly happy as is. As my trip faded, we engaged in deep conversation. My friend talked about his darkest dreams and experiences, and I talked about how those didn't define him, and how people aren't pure or impure, and the best thing they can do is to accept themselves and others. By 1:45 AM, we both felt somewhat dazed and restless, so we each took a couple melatonin, and went to sleep around 2 am.

"Experience:4-AcO-DMT (20mg) - High Weight, No Effects","I want to preface this by saying this wasn't my direct experience - I was trip-sitting for a friend and found his experience might be useful for more accurate dosage information in the future. I (as well as other people) have taken the same batch of the chemical he took, multiple times, at 15-20mg and found it to be very effective. I do not believe the quality of the chemical is in question. My friend took this chemical at 9:30AM. He has no prior psychedelic experience, so I told him the best place to start is with a more reliable starting dosage like 20mg. I had read somewhere that Tryptamines are less sensitive to body weight issues, and I have heard subjective reports from other heavier friends of mine that 30mg doses were pretty intense. We decided to start smaller and not risk it. Right around 10:10AM my buddy told me he was starting to feel it, so we turned the music on and he tried to get comfortable. I was reading a book and noticed over the next half an hour he seemed sedated and had his eyes closed, I figured everything was going well. Maybe 30-40 minutes later he got up and walked to the bathroom just fine, this struck me weird simply because, my first experience with psychedelics I ended up having to crawl to the bathroom (which, maybe this isn't normal, but it raised a red flag anyway). At 11:10 he looks over at me, and I asked him how things were going. He said he's not really feeling it, that he felt a tiny bit of respiratory depression and some minor CEVs (I guess that were controllable) - he said he ""felt a bit of something"" but that it wasn't around anymore. It's now 12:20 roughly and nothing is happening. Apparently the best way he knows how to describe his current state is ""not great, kind of weirdly icky feeling, nothing happening visually or mentally, just physically kind of off"". I find this particularly interesting because, I've always heard about dosing things in mg/kg ratios, and how Tryptamines in general aren't as affected by this. Based on this experience I'd say there has to be *some* merit to it.","['internal hallucination', 'sedation']",473
Experience:20mg (insufflated) - Three years of sustained unity and interconnectedness,"I experience eye of providence visuals frequently during states of unity and interconnectedness. Unity and interconnectedness can be described as an alteration in the cognitive rules which define both what one's sense of self or identity is attributed to and what it is felt as separate from. For example, most people feel that the self is inherently separate from their external environment and could not possibly extend into it. I was eighteen years old when I first began experimenting with psychedelics. During my third or so trip on mushrooms, I experienced for the first time a state of unity and interconnectedness. I consider this one of the greatest trips of my life. During the trip, I wrote in my notebook the following: ""I have found god. I have found all of the answers of suffering. The answers are inside myself. I am god. Tripping allows you to see inside the control panel of your mind. Beyond all the daily annoyances (your inner life) there is the answer. There is god. God is inside of you. All you must do is close the door on what has made you “you” and endless possibilities await you. The answers are inside you. I cannot communicate with language what I have felt, I can only communicate with music. I have found god. I am god. God is everywhere. God is in everyone. We are all god, but only few realize it."" My next trip was 20mg of 4-aco-dmt insufflated; during this trip, I had rapid cycling thoughts and felt like I was discovering the secrets of the universe. I saw everyone and everything as myself. After the psychedelic had worn out, the intense feelings of unity and interconnectedness remained for the next four years. It was not a constant feeling, however, I did experience this feeling every single day. As a result of this 4-aco-dmt trip, I do not require any psychoactive substances to experience unity. Over the past four years I have experienced unity and interconnectedness thousands of times during everyday sober moments. My sense of self will shift 5 to 30 times a day from believing that I have an ego to becoming one with everything in the universe. When I experience unity, it directly changes what my sense of self is attributed to. My sense of self is capable of including systems which were previously perceived as separate to my identity or being. The experience of this alteration results in intense and inextricable feelings of unity or interconnectedness between myself and specific or multiple ""external"" systems. Many people who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, the destruction of which is often described as some sort of profound “awakening” or “enlightenment”. Depending on the degree to which this supposed illusion has been lifted, it can lead onto five possible levels of differing intensity and degrees of interconnectedness which can be read about here. It feels as though I am not separate from the external and like I'm the entire universe as a whole experiencing itself, exploring itself, and performing actions upon itself through the specific point in space and time which this particular body and conscious perception happens to currently reside within. The feeling feels similar to these quotations: ""The most astounding fact in the universe beyond the fact that anything exists at all, is that it has arranged itself to become self aware."" ""We are a way for the cosmos to know itself."" - Carl Sagan I am only using ""I"" out of convenience; instead I could say ""this particular body in which I am currently perceiving."" It is extremely easy for me to trigger states of unity if I take a psychedelic or dissociative. About 95% of my trips result in feeling unity. During one trip on ((huge combo here)), I experienced intense level 5 unity and external hallucinations of the statement ""YOU ARE GOD"" across my entire vision. I often see visuals of the eye pyramid when experiencing unity. Common triggers include: Reading about unity Talking about unity Hearing others talk about unity Psychedelics Dissociatives Submitted by - Oskykins",['unity and interconnectedness'],838
Experience:20mg - Relationship problems,"I had a bad trip on 20mg of 4-aco-dmt. It was not terrible nor was it too upsetting, but it was a great reminder for me about proper set and setting. I should not have tripped that day. First of all, I had already tripped. I had a great trip a couple days ago, and I should have waited. I was having trouble with my boyfriend. He wasn't responding to his phone (he was in another city) and I was scared that he didn’t like me anymore and was going to break up with me. So with all this on my mind, I still decided to trip. I went outside, but all I could fucking think about was my relationship problems. I didn’t know what to do. I decided I’d have to go inside because I couldn’t take it outside. I went inside, but I felt weird. I didn’t feel good… I just felt alien. I felt like a robot… It was so strange being human, at the time. I tried everything I could to stop the bad trip. I didn't have any visuals. I tried singing and dancing. It was not a terrible trip, but I felt afterwards, that it had exposed me to my darkest places… My fears… I have so much to deal with. I decided to drink. I felt good for a while but the feeling left me and my boyfriend finally called me. He broke up with me over the phone. I cried and had a panic attack. It was terrible. He was drunk and sorry that he had broken up with me while I was having a bad trip. I took opiates and drank the rest of my alcohol. I cried so fucking much. And for a few days after that, there was no happiness. I needed time to heal. I felt like all of my faults had been unleashed to me. I decided to stop tripping for awhile until I got caught up with my problems and fixed some things in my life. Submitted by - Oskykins",['emotion enhancement'],417
Experience:20mg (insufflated) - I was overcome with feelings about my family,"I snorted 20mg of 4-aco-dmt alone in my apartment, but there were few visuals. I believe this had to be due to my high tolerance. I had tripped frequently this week. My trip was still very powerful, however, as I was overcome with feelings. I was overcome with happiness for my mother. I was so happy that she found her boyfriend. I was so happy that she had someone to hug, talk to, cuddle with, and have sex with now that my father is dead. I was so happy that she didn’t have to be alone anymore. I was also overcome with sadness for what she lost with my father. I realized that I hadn’t cried over my father’s death and I finally just cried. I felt so terrible for my mother. I felt so bad that she had lost her husband. I cried for three hours straight. Sometimes I just screamed out from the tears and sometimes I collapsed onto the floor. The crying was not bad at all. It was beautiful. I needed to get out of the negative emotions out of my body and this was the way to do it. I cried and I felt negative emotions strongly, but I was not experiencing a bad trip. I also felt incredibly sad that my brother hasn't found a girlfriend and does not have a relationship of his own. I wanted him to be happy, like I am. I texted my brother to tell him that I loved him and that I wanted a better relationship with him. My boyfriend came over while I was coming down and we had a wonderful time together. My boyfriend and the 4-aco-dmt helped me realize that the relationship that you have with your family is very important. Submitted by - Oskykins","['emotion enhancement', 'introspection']",355
Experience:20mg - A profound sense of oneness,"I took 20mg of 4-aco-dmt with my tea at 3:18 PM in the bath tub of my apartment alone. Looking to pass the time in the bath, I decided to shave, but the nausea kicked in sooner than I thought and it was pretty difficult. During the nausea, I began getting weird thoughts about “fighting the nausea.” About an hour in at 4:20, the nausea went away and I began to feel like I was tripping. At one point, I felt like I was having a bad trip or had stopped tripping completely. I felt like the 4-aco-dmt hadn’t worked after all. I was ready to go back to my computer or back to bed when I figured I’d try to go outside. When I got outside, my trip totally changed. I saw beautiful visuals. At one point, I saw Obama (United States president) visuals everywhere. I saw visuals of multiple presidents on the underpass near my apartment. I felt like I was taking ‘the walk to enlightenment’ or something. I started seeing pyramid eye visuals everywhere. I saw faces in the sky. There was a black baby looking down at me from the sky. The wind became a part of me. I became a part of everything. A sense of oneness overcame me. I was so excited I started laughing out loud because I had realized the answer to the universe. I couldn’t stop smiling and laughing. I felt amazing. I wrote down: ""Wow. Never before have I realized the oneness of it all. We all are one. Even now, while tripping, I see eyes. A pyramid of an eye. I have seen the truth. Wow. I have figured out the universe. The oneness was a circle. The universe is a circle."" I was able to connect myself with all objects — rocks, the wind, other people. I thought it was beautiful how two people could find each other. How your consciousness can cling to a different shell of itself. Sex was beautiful for this reason. It allowed your consciousness to become one. Every time I would go inside to go to the bathroom, I would start having a bad trip. To aid this, I started singing. I listened to Vanessa Carlton’s music while tripping and it was fucking amazing. Music has never sounded better. And the things she would sing would sometimes connect with my thought processes. I could find meaning in her lyrics, meanings that weren’t there before. I realized that for love to exist, hate must exist. For anger to exist, peace must exist. Yin and yang. Opposite forces need each other for each to exist. I wanted to become a shell of peace and compassion. After walking for a while, I decided to head back in. I knew that if i went inside now, I would not be able to trip further. But I decided to head inside to record my thoughts about the trip. Unfortunately, I wasn’t really able to get anything out in words. This is what I wrote on Microsoft Word: ""wow. the wind wow wow wow i can’t even describe it WE ARE ALL ONE i don’t even know how to explain it. it is something you FEEL go back outside lol"" But it was cold and windy, so I decided to stay in. I was done with my trip for today. Hours later, I look on my phone and see that while outside I had written: ""The oneness of it all is fucking Incredible fucking incredible. We sre all one. I am this rock. Circle. The oneness of it all. Remember it.

Experience:20mg (insufflated) - permanent all-encompassing states of unity and interconnectedness,"After taking 20mg of 4-aco-dmt snorted, I was walking around alone outside listening to music and the visuals were more intense than anything I have ever experienced before. I was so happy and I did not feel any anxiety at all. The clouds had faces. Visuals were floating around in the air instead of staying on the ground. There was a very large nearly invisible/translucent entity standing in the middle of the sidewalk and road. It looked like some kind of dinosaur/rhino spirit animal. I couldn’t interact with it, it was just standing there. I moved out of the way of the animal and actually crossed the street to the other sidewalk because I did not want to walk inside of it. For some reason, I suspected that walking inside the animal would trigger ego death and I did not wish to experience this in the middle of the street. During this walk, I had rapid cycling thoughts and it felt like I was discovering the secrets of the universe. the walk felt timeless. I felt like the wind and the music were controlling my trip and thought process. I experienced the third truth from your “Psychedelic exposure to the inner mechanics of consciousness and its relationship to states of unity and interconnectedness post and it was the most powerful thing I had experienced at the time. This truth has changed my life. Almost a year later, I still see everyone as myself. You are me and I am you. I experience frission/asmr and whenever I read something that has to do with unity sober (like in Buddhism texts), I get a feeling of intense frisson that feels like I am having a mind orgasm and moves throughout my entire body. I now find it impossible to hate others or be mad at anyone ever because I realize that I am them. It is incredibly hard to explain, but your description matches what I felt and still feel perfectly. I consider this shroom trip one of the greatest days of my life, but it doesn’t come close to what happened when I took LSD a few days ago.

Experience:20mg - I looked up and saw an angry god-like figure made of clouds glaring down at me,"I usually experience really bad nausea after taking psychedelics, but I did not feel like throwing up during this trip. As an experiment, I swallowed 500mg worth of ground ginger root in two gel capsules thirty minutes before taking my capsule of 20mg 4-aco-dmt (it won’t work if you take it at the same time). This ginger supplement significantly reduced nausea and prevented me from throwing up. I will be taking ginger capsules thirty minutes before all of my trips from now on. Background: I am experienced with 4-aco-dmt/mushrooms, but because I had not tripped for over three months and have issues with general anxiety and social anxiety, I was very anxious about tripping again. I wanted a very therapeutic trip to ease me back into the psychedelic realm after a stressful couple of months. The purpose of this trip was for deep introspection and to reduce my anxiety levels. I had been avoiding my friends and acquaintances for months due to my social anxiety and I hoped that this trip would help me deal with my anxiety towards them. Before tripping, I asked the 4-aco-dmt if it would allow me to cry. I hadn’t cried in quite some time and I felt like I needed a release. At 3:00 PM I grabbed a bottle of water, put earbuds in, turned on my ipod, smoked hash oil, swallowed 20mg of 4-aco-dmt, and walked outside. The setting was a beautiful sunny day with a temperature of around 80 degrees. I spent the beginning of my trip walking along familiar streets downtown. At 3:35 PM I began feeling very strange. I experienced a lot of anxiety during the come-up, but was successful at calming myself down with my thoughts. I became aware that the 4-aco-dmt was going to force me to face my demons / fears today and I was ready for them. I said to the 4-aco-dmt, “Give them to me one by one.” Five minutes later, I ran into my ex-boyfriend downtown. We are on good terms and still hang out. Due to my social anxiety, however, I had been avoiding all of my friends, family, housemates, co-workers, and acquaintances for awhile. I was very worried about seeing someone that I knew while tripping, but when it happened the anxiety wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. I hugged him, told him I was coming up on shrooms, and I made plans with him to hang out later this weekend. I felt like I had just conquered my first demon. While walking down the sidewalk, I looked down and noticed visuals -- symmetrical texture repetition. I ran into my supervisor outside of the building that I work at. At first I was terrified that I would have to make conversation with him, but he simply said “hi” and walked past me. I am usually scared of going to work because I am so anxious about talking to co-workers, but after this, I felt less afraid. I felt like I had conquered my second demon. I continued walking along familiar streets. At around 3:50 PM I experienced visual acuity enhancement of the sky and pattern recognition enhancement in the clouds. I looked up and saw an angry god-like figure made of clouds glaring down at me. He looked like the typical Christian white-bearded god and had sharp, pointed ears to show that he was expressing anger. God’s arms were spread wide and around him, also made of clouds, were his angels. As an agnostic who has little interest in Christianity, I usually do not expect Christian images to come up in my trips. However, throughout this entire trip, my thoughts often turned to Christianity. I was curious to know why the Christian god was glaring angrily down at me/humanity. Pattern recognition enhancement in the clouds gave me a hallucination similar to the Creation of the Sun, Moon, and Plants (1511) by Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564). A couple days after this trip, I Google imaged “angry god” and came upon Michelangelo’s painting The Creation of the Sun, Moon, and Plants located on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. This painting, located on the left side of the page, is similar to what I saw in the clouds, although it has its differences. Cloud-god was facing down towards me, he looked much angrier, there were no male cloud-angels, the female cloud-angels were spread out differently, and I could not see the facial expressions. So here I am, walking down the street looking up at the Christian god glaring down at me. I think “I don’t know what you’re trying to tell me, god. I’m not a believer.” I wasn’t scared of the presence for some reason. During my walk, I felt oddly blessed by the wrathful Christian god and his angels. I had a delusion that god was literally watching me during this trip and teaching me things. I also confirmed that I was indeed god. At around 4:00 PM I asked the figure in the clouds, “Why so angry, god?” And a voice replied back, “Yeah, god, why so angry?” I thought for a while and replied back “I am angry because everything is not perfect. I am angry at myself and humanity for giving into evil…” After this, I felt a lot better. Things were starting to get trippier and I noticed some little men working inside my brain. I could communicate with them and they would communicate back to me. I asked the little men inside my brain to change my vision to green just for fun. A few seconds later, the colors in my vision shifted to purple. “Huh? What happened? I thought you were changing my visuals to green.” I thought. “Why not purple? Everything is already green outside!” said one of the little men inside my brain. This was true. I was walking down a very green garden-type area. Feeling anxiety again, I asked the little men inside my brain if I could stop fear with my mind and if they would help. They said sure and I mentally pictured myself cutting my fear with scissors. I started getting a weird body high after this and wondered if I had accidentally cut the wrong cord inside my body because I was still experiencing fear and my body started to feel weird. During one of my past trips on 4-aco-dmt, I saw a translucent rhino-dinosaur entity and crossed the street to avoid stepping inside of it. During my current trip, I saw the same entity but this time it leapt in front of me, surprising the shit out of me and causing me to accidentally step inside of it. While I was inside of the rhino-dinosaur entity, more translucent rhino-dinosaur entities appeared around me and I had strange thoughts concerning an Earth that is mind-controlled by invisible rhino-dinosaurs. At around 4:30 PM my body started getting physically tired. I was also very hot and dehydrated, so I decided to journey back to my house and face my last demon – my housemates. Things felt more and more epic as I got closer to home. I walked into my house and experienced a direct morphing effect. I walked up the stairs and noticed the hallway in front of my room seemed smaller/thinner than usual. I heard my neighbor shuffling around and his door was open. I wanted to quickly sneak into my room before he noticed me because of my social anxiety. The hallway was dark, but I saw that there was enough light to get my key in. When I moved closer to the door, however, the colors shifted and my vision suddenly got darker and I was unable to get my key into the lock. It felt like the shrooms were forcing me to socialize by shifting the colors around it making it impossible for me to open my door and hide. I walked to the other side of the hallway to the light switch, passed my neighbor (who I had never met before), and turned on the light switch. My neighbor came out of his room. He had his personal furniture and items all over the hallway, so I casually asked him if he was moving out. He replied “Nope, just cleaning out my closet.” “Me too, dude, me too...” He went back into his room. This is the first time that I have talked to him. Another housemate’s seven year old daughter came up to me in the hallway while I was opening my door and I asked if she would like to paint nails sometime. I agreed to paint nails in a couple days and then walked into my bedroom. I felt as if I had just faced my last demon – my anxiety surrounding my housemates. I sat on my bed and my focus shifted to deep introspection. I felt like crying but no tears were coming out. I realized that I was very dehydrated and got a glass of orange juice. As soon as I had a drink, the tears flowed out. My crying was quiet at first but then got louder and louder. I thought about everything bad that had happened to me and all of my faults. I cried because I wanted so badly to connect with someone but can’t. I often feel like I am missing a part of me. And that missing this part means that I will never be able to form a deep connection with anyone. I also saw eye of providence visuals on the walls of my bedroom. I couldn’t stop sobbing. I cried and cried and cried and it felt like the sadness and the tears were coming from somewhere very deep inside of me. During this time, it felt like a mother-figure was holding me from inside and comforting me. Eventually, my sobbing turned into giggles and then back again and then repeated. I was both crying and laughing at the same time and I felt so euphoric. It felt like an enormous weight had been lifted. When I looked at the clock, the time read 5:00 PM. I experienced feelings of unity and interconnectedness. I felt like I was god and all humans and animals and molecules. I stopped being afraid of death. It felt like my life was a big joke because I had created everything in this universe and I was still completely and utterly alone. I experienced visual patterns of the eye of providence on my wall. I looked in the mirror. In my face I saw the faces of all men and women on earth. I also felt like I could see and feel all of the muscles in my body. I was captivated by the sight of my body breathing. I could see my lungs pumping in and out with such beautiful detail and intensity. I saw tribal marks on my face and skin. Enhancement of pre-existing tactile sensations. For the next few hours while coming down, I experienced increased connectivity of thought, feelings of fascination, and introspection. I had a lot of thoughts concerning Christianity and its main figures and I kept connecting psychedelics to religious experiences. I played around with the progressive transformations in the textures of my room, focusing and defocusing my vision to experience different transformations. I thought a lot about my place in the universe, how I am connected to everything, and what I can do to improve my quality of living. Time distortion was present during the entire trip.

Experience:Sleep paralysis,"My daily routine consists of waking up around 6:30AM and leaving for work by 7AM. Work lasts until 5:00PM and I get home around 6PM. For a few days I had been working longer than usual hours at another job and I wasn't getting a decent amount of rest. I went to bed at 12:15AM. I fall asleep within 10 minutes. Sleep paralysis I remember opening my eyes and looking at my nightstand where my clock read 3:42AM. There is whispering outside of my door and I hear my parents. Female: ""Is Potato asleep?"" Male: ""What?"" Female: ""Yes. He's asleep."" I hear steps going down the stairs to the basement outside my door. My door opens. I try to speak up but I can't. Breathing is fine. Slow and deep. More than paralysis I feel extreme exhaustion. I don't have the energy to open my mouth. I feel lethargic. A dark figure walks into my room from the right side of my field of view. It's the female. I see her hair in a ponytail. She's a completely black outline filled in with scribbles, almost a static silhouette. She makes her way over to the left side of my room and looks out the window. I manage to speak up albeit mumbling. ""Mmnno. Mm awake."" She doesn't hear me and makes her way back out of the room. My eyes close and I fall back asleep. Post-Experience I don't sleep well and wake up at 4:02AM. I fade in and out of sleep. Knowing I have work in the morning prevents me from going back into a deep sleep. Upon speaking with my parents the next day they inform me that they went to sleep before 1AM.

Experience:Meditation with cannabis - terminated ego loss,"1½ decent dose of ingested cannabis few hours before the experience I spent a sunday being slightly hangover and not doing much anything spesific, only short shamatha meditation for a while. In the evening a friend came by and we ate cannabis brownies, one and a half each. We spent a few hours talking and playing backgammon, I noticed how unusually focused I got in the game. Usually I might ponder my possible move perhaps one or two moves ahead, but then I would go on paths covering branching possibilities which felt endless, although I still couldn't figure out the best move and thought that there actually isn't an absolute one considering the nature of the game. Later when my friend had left, I decided to meditate again as I felt generally focused and the idea was really comfortable. I started my usual routine with some buddhist prayers and a visualisation of my buddha statue and a visualized buddha on top of my head glowing golden light. This produced a very pleasent warm sensation all over my body and my focus got more intense. The statue I was looking at started to seem as actually glowing, although it was different from what I was trying to visualize. The light wasn't golden, but blue instead, and it seemed that the statue itself was turning into this glowing light, starting from the uppermost edge. I was exhilarated as this phenomenom was something I had almost invariably experinenced only after taking substances of the actual psychedelic category. I felt unity with the statue and the idea of buddha, first as a subjective cognition of 'me being almost the same as buddha'. I tried to consciously close this gap, which I felt was an unnecessary dualistic delusion. Trying didn't seem to do any good though and an idea popped in my head, that I could try to first become the same as a buddha's image. I stood up and faced a wall cloth which has an image of buddha as a roughly real-sized human. I closed my eyes and pressed against the cloth and the wall behind it, and I could feel myself moving slowly trough the wall, which I cognized as a metaphor for becoming the same with buddha image. At the same time I started to see/hallucinate a completely different view, one of an animal of some sort moving in a forest, in a first person viewpoint. This rushed a train of thoughts: I thought I was on the verge of enlightenment. This would mean, that it would be unnecessary for my mind to continue inhabit this body I was leaving behind, as the person I used to be would from then onwards act in a perfect harmony, bringing as much happiness as possible to everybody around it. But the catch was that 'I' would cut the tie with my current being and move into another being, that of an undefined animal form, and I would start the process of reaching for enlightenment again, from the beginning. I imagined this was the mechanism of how to 'liberate all sentient beings'. I was frightened of the unknown future and felt great attachment to my current self, which I didn't want to lose, and I backed out. Soon after I felt that the whole idea was rather ridiculous, as it didn't really match with my concept of enlightenment. I tried to focus on becoming same with the buddha again, but now it led me to another delusion. I felt that everything in my life, all the people in it and all my experiences had been only in order to bring me to this point. And thus everything was about me, all of the outer reality was only an illusion in my mind. Somehow this led me to a thought: I had already died before, and this life I was now living was only some kind of an afterlife limbo. I was terrified and backed out from following this thought further, and wanted just to feel alive again and started to pace around my room. I tried to think it trough rationally; how could there be some condition of life, from which I would have already been dead, if this life I'm now experiencing is the only life I know? The rationale seemed reasonable, but didn't help with my feeling of fear and the general sense of illusionary nature of external reality. I wanted my surroundings to feel solid again, and I went to see if my housemate would still exist, I woke him up and had a comforting conversation with him. Soon afterwards I felt exhausted and went to bed soon.

Experience:5 months of daily mantra chanting - Oneness through meditation,"This is an account of how I achieved a level 3 state of unity and interconnectedness through meditation and without the use of hallucinogens. Prior to the experience I had been practising the meditation technique known as mantra chanting twice a day for 5 months. I did this every day for a total of 30 minutes in the morning at sunrise and 30 - 60 minutes after dinner, rarely if ever breaking this schedule. The mantra itself was a traditional chant from the teachings of Nichiren Daishonin[1], a Buddhist monk who lived in japan and taught devotion to the Lotus Sutra[2] (entitled Myōhō-Renge-Kyō in Japanese)— which contained Buddha's teachings towards the end of his life as the exclusive means to attain enlightenment. The chant itself is pronounced as ""nam myoho renge kyo""[3] and can be roughly translated as ""I devote myself to the mystic law of the lotus sutra"". This chant is traditionally repeated over and over again whilst staring at what is known as an enshrined gohonzon[4]. (see image) Towards the end of this 5 month period I achieved a state of unity at the end of an intense 2 week period of mantra mediation. I would partake in two hours of mediation or Daimoku, as it's called in the practice of Nichiren Buddhism, for one hour in the morning, as close to sunrise as possible, and a hour in the evening. I continued this routine for two and a half weeks without fail. At the end of the two and a half weeks, I started my mediation that evening as normal and about 40 minutes into the chanting I entered a trance-like state. This was how I described it at the time, but now through use of hallucinogens I can relate it closer to psychedelic ego death as I lost all sense of self and did not know who or what I even was. In this state I was able to analyse the problems I was trying to help solve through mediation without any personal attachment or interference from the ego, to which I then felt oneness with the entirety of my environment. I began to feel that myself and everything around me were in perfect equilibrium, it reacted to me as I did to it in perfect harmony. This feeling only lasted minutes, which was probably due to my age, knowledge and life experiences as the sudden change in perspective shocked and scared me bringing me out of the feeling of oneness and back into my normal state of consciousness.

"Experience:Pregabalin (450mg, oral) + Methylphenidate (20mg, oral) - Gaba Flipping","T+ 0:00 - I take 20mg of methylphenidate (MPH) and 450mg of pregabalin (PGN) (both by mouth with water). I had an empty stomach because I had only a glass of milk for breakfast (one hour prior). I was completely healthy the day before and the day of this experience. T+ 0:10 - Feel like i have to use the bathroom. I always have sudden bowel movements only minutes after taking ritalin, so this is to be expected. T+ 0:20 - Feeling very very faint mental and bodily stimulation. Not sure if this is placebo or if I'm just now starting to feel the effects of the drugs. T+ 0:26 - Definitely feeling some mild mental stimulation in my head. T+ 0:34 - Had to help my co-worker set-up a monitor for some testing, it was a simple task but it felt like absolutely nothing. I was indifferent to the task but I still made some small talk with my co-worker. Don't get me wrong, it was NOT bad, but it was not notably improved. I did feel a definite increase in my resting heart rate and a faster rate of thought. I was able to quickly sort through some cables to find one I was seeking. Normally I struggle to count many similar looking objects like tiny black cables but now it seemed quite easy. I attribute this to the Ritalin. T+ 0:42 - Just been on my laptop for a few minutes, adding details to this report. I've noticed that when I stop typing, it makes it easy to focus on my resting heartrate and it brings a slight sense of discomfort. Like stimulation that is too much. I've felt this before and it always happens to me on Ritalin when I run out of tasks to pre-occupy myself with. I'm actually typing this so that I can avoid that feeling haha. I am going to walk around for a bit to see if anything interests me arond the office as its quiet here today (two of my other co-workers are out). T+ 0:54 - Still feel like there's more bowel movement. Despite this, I am not hungry. So far it mainly just feels like the methylphenidate is hitting me. This is fine as PGN always takes a little longer for me to feel it. By the time the MPH peaks I'll probably start feeling the effects of the PGN more prominently. I have plenty of water for my dry mouth, but it isn't that dry today surprisingly. T+ 1:10 - Definitely feeling some prominent focus enhancement, whenever I start a conversation or I'm doing something, I'm entirely focused on the subject. I find myself just enjoyably working on whatever task is at hand, and don't stop unless it's done or something else catches my attention. I also want to consider that this warm tingly feeling in the back of my head could be considered ""cognitive euphoria"" as well, it's hard to explain but it's a very nice sensation that leaves me smiling a bit to myself. I would consider it to be mild though, likely due to the ""relatively"" low doses (for me). T+ 1:26 - I decide I've had enough of the bowel movement so I'm going to the bathroom again. While there, I messaged a close friend and was very happy during the conversation. I enjoyed making them laugh and seeing how their day was going. I was very appreciative of them in that moment. Even more than usual (which is a LOT) T+ 1:46 - I just feel like talking to my co-workers a lot, we're just having a pleasant conversation about random relatable topics. It's very nice, I feel like the PGN is starting to kick in because there is a distinct mental stimulation that I recognize from PGN. I also feel even more physically comfortable. T+ 2:02 - Went outside for a vape break. My co-worker vapes but I don't, I just like having a break to get some fresh air. So no nicotine was consumed in this experience. I felt the warmth of the sun on my skin and it felt amazing! I could sit out there all day. My skin was tingling with goodness. My face felt wonderful. I also felt a bit lighter in weight when going outside, this is another noticeable effect from the PGN kicking in. It wasn't like i lost coordination but I did feel overall lighter. I feel like I can see in a higher frame rate. Like a 60hz monitor compared to a 144hz monitor. I also noticed that everything was noticeably more... colorful? Just a noticeable increase in color, but nothing too crazy. T+ 2:20 - Co-worker put some music on the speaker in the office. Since only me and my friendly co-worker were the only ones at the office, we were able to play music we liked. I enjoyed it a lot more than usual. The bass was noticeably louder and really added to the experience. T+ 2:40 - I feel the mental stimulation rising very fast. My head feels comfortable with a small amount of pressure on my forehead. Comfortable though. I now feel very hungry because its nearly lunch and all I had was milk. So, I will eat some food. T+ 7:40 - I had lunch earlier, the last few hours have been fairly tame. I've been in a good mood and I still feel a slight buzz in my head. In the time before, there was nothing too eventful, the effects that persisted during this time were mainly from the PGN. I still felt much lighter and all colors around me still seemed a bit brighter. I enjoyed talking to people and was very sociable during this time. I believe I'm on the comedown now, It's not bad though because PGNs comedown is quite pleasurable for some people, me included. It negated the comedown of MPH which normally makes me uncomfortably stimulated and anxious.","['affection and sociability enhancement', 'analysis enhancement', 'cognitive euphoria', 'color enhancement', 'dry mouth', 'empathy', 'focus enhancement', 'frequent urination', 'increased heart rate', 'increased music appreciation', 'mental and physical stimulation', 'perception of bodily lightness', 'thought acceleration']",1269
"Experience:DXM (340 mg) + DMT (30 mg, smoked) + Cannabis - Amazing Synergy","I took 340 mg of DXM in gel capsules at around 9 PM out of a combination of boredom and some nasty congestion in my sinuses. By 10:30 PM I was experiencing comfortable levels of dissociation and detachment. I had a kind of static over my vision (probably from a lack of visual acuity) and behind my eyes were blurry static colors. Nothing very significant, Ive had effects like these from good weed alone. I did feel a lack of any anxiety however, which put me in the perfect mood to smoke some DMT. I put as close to 30 mg as I could but my scale jumped around quite a bit, so it could have been more or less. I smoked the DMT around 10:45 PM. Without any pre-trip anticipation it was easy to take a huge rip off my Yocan Evolve e-vape (it's most often used for dabs but it works extremely well for DMT, far better than any crack pipe or the machine I built out of a glass bottle and brillo). I held my hit in for an undetermined amount of time, but I am sure it was much longer than 10 seconds. I immediately felt the typical surge of activity and awareness throughout my body accompanied with typical mushroom type visuals. This swiftly led to the traditional visionary type experience, feeling I was separated from my body and was flying through a pulsing ever changing environment. There I flew past the typical shape-shifting geometric beings, with their humanoid or animal-like forms, roaming about doing whatever they do. I am very familiar with this experience but wasn't expecting to access it without at least 40 mg of DMT. I felt that I was in this state where I was half aware but half submerged in hyperspace, like the DXM let me drift further into my DMT experience but also let me more easily come back to a more aware state if I so wished. I found after my DMT trip that the DXM trip was suddenly vastly more visual. I could vividly see morphing patterns throughout my visual static for hours, but I could ignore it more easily than with traditional psychedelics. In fact I could easily have gone to sleep at any point. I was surprised how much synergy DXM and DMT had. I especially enjoyed the added intensity and increased duration of open and closed eye visuals which were massively increased for the DXM. I felt afterward that my DXM closed eyed visuals were much more otherworldly and immersive for a few hours after smoking the DMT. I also expect smoking marijuana throughout the night intensified the high. Keep in mind I was only at the second plateau for DXM before smoking DMT but afterword could access effects from the third DXM plateau (like flying through mental environments with eyes closed). I wrote this report on the comedown, and was still experiencing open and closed eyed visuals that were rather lucid and easy to ignore, but could be quite impressive when engaged with.

Experience:Nightmare flipping,"Let me just start by saying that I love deliriants, and this is what made me try out this infamous ""nightmare flipping"" combination of MDMA with dyphenhydramine. As there are pretty much no records of people combining the two I was unsure of how much MDMA to take, so I started low with a bomb of 100mg taken at the same time with 700mg of DPH. About an hour in I started feeling antisocial and the slight impending doom feeling. That meant the DPH started to kick in, but I felt no sign of MDMA. I decided to quickly make another bomb while I could. I took 50mg more of MDMA with orange juice (tends to potentiate MDMA apparently) then hid away my stash and patiently waited. Some time later I started hallucinating, but the DPH impending doom and anxiety has disappeared. This must be the MDMA's doing. Anyway the rest of the trip was just me deliriously tripping balls, talking to myself and trying to pee every 10 minutes. I don't normally hallucinate lots from 700mg because of my high tolerance but the MDMA seemed to have made the hallucinations a lot more frequent. Would recommend this to anyone that enjoys deliriant trips and now that I know the combination didn't kill me I can confirm it is safe. Recommend 150mg+ of MDMA because any less tends to be overpowered by DPH. Enjoy the spiders!

"Experience:A combination of DOC, 5-MAPB, 5-MeO-DMT, ETH-LAD, Cannabis, Pentedrone","Tonight was prom night. Hadnt had a real intense trip for a while, so i decide tonight was the night. 10 am - I take the bupropion as my normal medication alongside the first dose of dextroamphetamine. 5 pm - I take the second dose of dextroamphetamine. This is an average dose for me and i feel mildly stimulated. 5:45 pm - I arrive at the party. We proceed to take pictures and then depart for dinner. 6:15 pm - We have arrived at the restaurant, I proceed to the bathroom, where I ingest the 5-mapb, the doc, and place the Eth-lad tab under my tongue. I hold this for about 20 minutes in mouth before swallowing. 6:45 pm - My friend notices my cheeks are flushed. This is usually the telltale sign I have ingested a psychedelic. At this point, I have begun to feel the 5-mapb, I began laughing inappropriately loud, and just, in general, am having a fantastic time, eating a delicious burger, which I, unfortunately, couldnt finish because my appetite had disappeared. Distortions begin to creep across my vision, patterns swirling together, color enhancement and other mild OEVs. I become incredibly chatty at this point, which is not how I am normally, and find my self socially adept. There are two of my ex-girlfriends in the group, which initially I was anxious about because it is rather uncomfortable to be even near them normally, but I found myself at ease, acknowledging this phenomenon but not worrying about it. I enjoy the company of my friends. I proceed to distribute 25D-NBOMe, 4-FA, 5-MAPB and other assorted hallucinogens to my fellow group members. 7pm - We proceed to the party bus, and I have been designated as the ""dj"" so to speak, connecting the aux cord to my phone and just making sure everyone remains high-energy. I play a variety of hip-hop songs, primarily Travis Scott, Kanye West, Pusha t, Asap Rocky, drake and young thug. Psychedelics increase my ability to remember song lyris for some reason, so when we all sat down, and it was quiet, I got everyone pumped by just dancing ridiculously and rapping along not missing a single bar. I am having a fantastic time and feel great about everything. 8pm-12pm - The party bus arrives at the function prom is being held at. At this point, the doc is beginning to enhance the visuals and stimulation significantly, and the 5-Mapb and eth-lad's effects are peaking. Visuals are quite fascinating, double vision, drifting, acuity enhancement, color splashes randomly affecting regions of my visions. DOC has a very synthetic, futuristic visual style with small wheels spinning in the place of pixels so to speak, I can still see fine, but everything is distorted to some point now. We enter the party at this point; my social anxiety disorder kicks in and I stick close to my best friend, so I don't lose anybody or fuck up the entry procedure to the club. I am a bit nervous and just anxious to find a corner to get away from the throbbing crowd dancing to EDM, and we find an upstairs level with a table with few people around where we sit and talk for a few hours, taking breaks to get water or go to the bathroom frequently. I am anxious to leave, but this is not the psychedelics fault, likely, without their help, I wouldn't have been able to go at all. Friends from the crowd see me and people begin to stop occasionally to ask me for Molly, psychedelics, etc. I make 5 or so sales, but there is an old bald man who keeps staring at me, and I begin to become quite paranoid. This man was a school official and seemed quite suspicious of me. We decide to go to the dance floor to get away from this man. 15 minutes later he walks right by me on the dancefloor, and this only increases my paranoia. I hide my stash in my underwear and begin to leave with part of my group. Just as we are leaving the man is right by the entrance, and I'm sure he will stop me. I brace myself for the inevitable and attempt to act normal, but the man says nothing as we walk out. We chill outside for a little bit, waiting for the rest of our party to join us. The man comes outside. I am very nervous at this point. The trip is borderline, could go very negative from here. However, he goes back inside and my friends come out, and we leave. We proceed to the house we will be staying the night at, and when we arrive we decide to insufflate pentedrone and 5-meo-dmt. The trip gets a bit stronger, but not by much. We do another line of pentedrone. Some people wanted to smoke cannabis, so I found my herbal vaporizer, and we proceeded to vape outside, and then we come back. I do another line of pentedrone as I am getting quite tired. I eventually fall asleep around 5:30 am. The trip is over at this point. The DOC was also used 4 days earlier, so tolerance was understandable as to why the trip wasnt that intense. Overall, a positive trip with a small bump in the middle. No lasting side effects noted after I woke up.

"Experience:3-MeO-PCP, LSD, Clonazolam, and Amphetamine - Excessive Amounts and Excessive Confusion","The night begins at approximately 8 pm. 8pm- I ingest the BisFluoromodafinil (let’s call it BFM for the sake of brevity) to help keep me awake for finishing my schoolwork. I begin to work on my Calculus homework. 11pm- My mother comes home, and we get into an argument about something unrelated to school and drugs. This argument leaves me quite angry and frustrated. I have various anxiety and depression related disorders, so let us just say that I do not handle my anger very well. I cannot sleep, mostly because of the BFM, but partially my anger as well. I decide I want to get massively fucked up and forget the problems I have been stressed about lately. 12am- I insufflate about 5 mg of 3-MeO-PCP, and then decide it hurts too much so I whip out my 0.001g scale and begin to measure out approximately 15 mg. I pour out way too much because my hands are shaking, ending with approximately 85 mg, to which I say, fuck it, what is the worst that could happen? Bear in mind, I had no tolerance to dissociatives, and this was the first disso I had ingested in over a month. After this, I begin to insufflate 5-MAPB, but it hurts this time, and I put it all away because my nose hurts too bad to want to do anything but sleep. 12:30 am- My nose has stopped hurting, and I realize I have never combined a psychedelic and a dissociative before. I had five strips of LSD in pieces of foil, I retrieve one and open it, intending to take only one tab, but this is precisely when the 3-MeO-PCP kicked in. Now, my blotters were not perforated, and difficult to separate without scissors. Feeling the first wave of dissociation, I begin to lose the ability to move my hands correctly and fail to rip the blotters. I ingested all five tabs; I know this because I saw the empty foil on my ground some time later. Unfortunately, at the precise moment, I put the tabs in my mouth is when my memory ends. ??am- My memory begins again sometime later. I cannot tell you what time it is because I have the lost the ability to read a digital clock. As I attempt to read it, the numbers swiftly move out of my vision, and then back. This happens constantly. I attempt to look at my phone but could not turn it on. I finally notice something a bit damp in my bed. Later, I would realize I was lying in a pool of vomit, mostly comprised of stomach acid. I had not eaten since 6 pm the night before. I attempt to stand up. As I do this, I realize I have lost the ability of depth perception, and I trip on my nightstand and fall onto the ground. I do not feel much, and walking makes no sense to me. I somehow manage to drag myself back onto my bed, where I begin to vomit again. My body is in a fetal position, convulsing with each hurl, which is nonstop. My stomach hurts greatly from the excessive vomiting. At some point, I chewed on a piece of regurgitated food, unknowingly, thinking it tasted rather odd. I was intrigued, by this, and continued nibbling, until I vomited again and I realized what it was, as more of the same material had just emerged from my mouth. My memory after this merely consists of me vomiting and writhing in my bed for hours. 5:30 am- I finally can read the clock! I get up, as I have school at 7:10 am, and sit at the breakfast table in the dark, in a random skirt I threw on real quick and possibly a bra. I cannot remember if I covered my top half. My mother comes out at 6 am. She is crying about something. I do not remember what our conversation was about, but eventually, she went to take a shower, and I did not move from the chair during this time. She comes out and hands me my daily medicine, and then goes to her room, presumably to get changed. I ingest the pills and proceed to the kitchen sink where I immediately threw up six times in quick succession. I go to my room, and take the disgusting sheets and throw them in the washing machine. When my mother comes out, I tell her I am very sick and have vomited a lot. She helps me start the washing machine. I then enter the bathroom, where I stay for 25 minutes. I had to urinate extremely bad, but nothing would come out. My bladder begins to ache severely. I forget I am in the bathroom until my mother knocks on the door asking if I am alright. I tell her I am having trouble urinating, and will be out for a minute. When I look in the mirror, I see a disheveled, dirty girl with a morphing face and am rather disturbed. I begin crying, as I believe I have reached a very low point in my life and that I have just become some useless junkie. 6:20 am- I still think I will be going to school at this time, so I ingest a pill of Adderall that I found in the pocket of my skirt. Nothing happens for five minutes. Getting worried that I am tripping too much, I had heard that if you ingest benzos, it will stop a trip. What I didn’t know was that this meant you would be going to sleep. I had just presumed I would stop hallucinating. Bear in mind; I am still very much peaking on the LSD at this point. Now, I had no tolerance to benzos either. I vaguely remembered I had some 500μg tabs of Clonazolam somewhere. I assumed that one tab was a decent dose, not knowing that was actually at the upper end of the strong dosage range. I put a single tab under my tongue. I feel nothing for five minutes and begin to panic, so again I say fuck it and throw two more tabs in my mouth. 6:30 am- I have sat back down in my chair at the table, and put my head down because I am getting tired. I tell my mom that I will need to stay home that day and she agrees. She tells me I will be much more comfortable in the recliner since she could see I was tired. I agree and go down. I instantly black out. ??am- Now, everything after this point until about 8 pm is merely what my mother told me had happened. I have a few bits and pieces later on, but mostly my memory is shot. She told me after some amount of time of me sleeping in the chair she tried to wake me up to take me to a normal doctors office. When I would not wake, she began to get worried and decided I needed to go to the urgent care center. She is too weak to carry me, so essentially she dragged me down about 25 stairs to the ground level. Apparently, once we got off the stairs, I stood up and said, ""ok let's go to the car,"" and walked all the way to my seat, and then fell asleep again. We arrive at the urgent care center, but I would not wake up, and she could not drag me across the pavement. She goes in to talk to the doctors, and they come out to see me but say that they cannot touch me without my consent. They tell my mom to take me to the emergency room. We arrive at the emergency room, and I am taken on a stretcher somewhere, presumably still in just a bra (or not) and a miniskirt. I wake up apparently, and the doctors ask me what happened. I told them I had ingested Clomethiazole to help me sleep because BFM was keeping me up. Now, for those who aren’t familiar, clomethiazole is a very old prescription sedative drug used briefly back in the 40s-60s ish. I had obtained this drug legally through a Clearnet RC vendor and told my mom it was a supplement to aid my sleep when I got it. So, the reason for telling the doctors this was probably because I wanted to cover my ass and not admit to drug usage, but at the same time give them something plausible to go off of. Presumably, I probably had realized I would be fine after the clonazolam had worn off and I woke up, I would just have to ride it out. The doctors, of course, had no idea what the fuck kind of drug clomethiazole was, so apparently I even spelled it out for them to google it. I do not remember what she said happened after that, the next thing I do remember is waking up in an ER bed, comfy, still having to pee like a motherfucker (it has been about 15 hours at this point since my last successful urination). Someone offered me a delicious burger and milk, my favorite drink. I devoured them quickly and then feel asleep. I woke up again later, and the same thing happened. This time I stayed awake for a little while, and a toxicologist came in to run tests. We had a conversation about research chemicals, where he was attempting to dissuade me from using them ever again. I concurred that some were dangerous, the likes of MDMB-FUBINACA had killed many, but if used responsibly, had a therapeutic benefit(I clearly did not understand the irony of my argument at the time). We naturally argued until he left. My mother then told me that we had the exact conversation an hour before. Crazy. I fall asleep and wake up to a male nurse who says he is going to help me pee. I say okay, not sure what he meant, and then he proceeds to insert a catheter into my vagina. This was entirely unexpected, as I did not realize I no longer had my skirt on, and for other obvious reasons. This is very uncomfortable and hurts greatly, but I begin to urinate. I thank him, as he is doing it, with his hands in my vagina, and tell him I also have had problems with achieving an orgasm, was there anything I could do to make that happen? This was entirely innocent and serious question, just at the wrong time to the wrong person. I still had the LSD headspace at this time. He made a very odd face and told me something along the lines of “talk to your GP doctor about that, not me.” I realize the implications of what I had just said, and turn very red, as I also realize the nurse is quite attractive. I am embarrassed beyond belief. I do not remember much else except I was finally let out of the ER at 9 pm and went home, and then slept. I felt very foggy and mentally impaired as if my IQ had dropped 40 points, for the next five days. Then one morning I woke up and felt fine and went to school, and that was the end of that. No lasting problems developed. Obviously, there were a great many mistakes made on this journey. This actual trip itself was mostly unpleasant, and I had no spiritual moments, just a general lack of coherent thoughts for much of it. Someday I will revisit 3-MeO-PCP and LSD, at sane dosages, but I have been quite fearful of this for a while now. A month after this experience, I resumed normal drug usage again, which is to say, mostly new research chemicals I sample and then move on, and have been fine and remained at a responsible level of usage, having no real issues with this one.

"Experience:An Excessive Amount - N,N DMT / Marijuana - Stuck Inside an Egg","I had been experimenting with DMT for some time by the start of this experience, so I didn't really feel like anything could phase me at this point. Many of my friends were curious about what I was doing. They had heard about a previous trip I had where me and one of my brothers had mixed together some DMT in a bowl of weed, and passed it back and forth so we could trip together. DMT is hardly an experience you can share, I learned this with my brother previously, I learned it again this time. Preparation This was an unknown amount of DMT Combined with decent Cannabis into one large sized marijuana bowl. There were to be 4 people on the bowl, so instead of weighing it out, I simply packed as much as i could in the bowl. It was a very deep bowl, easily enough to get around to us multiple times, I thought. I started with a screen in the bottom, placed some ""previously smoked on"" pot ash over the screen to catch any DMT that may have ran to the screen. I placed a small layer of marijuana over that, then a layer of the spice over that. Then another layer of weed and another layer of DMT. I repeated this process 5-6 times before finally leaving a layer of green on the top of the bowl. ""Now,"" I told everyone, "" This is going to need to get around to each of us a few times, so don't hit it with the flame directly. Just burn the weed so it embers and allow the embers to carry over to the DMT. Take a good hit and pass it, we will each need to hit it about three times"" Experience I, of course, am the first in line. I proceed to take my hit, as cautiously and slowly as I can, so that I don't burn away any of the ""good stuff"", and I feel the effects immediately. My stomach feels an immense pressure, I needed to cough, but I know that, if I cough, I will throw up. This pressure was too much, I barley made it to the trashcan before my entire body is plunged into a realm of seemingly boring, gray and black, static triangles locked into one another to form a round force field of some kind. Separating me from the world around me. This is my entire world, Me, this trashcan, and the triangles in every direction I look. I am still connected to my body, and feel an incredibly powerful tingling sensation, accompanied by a heavy pressure that moves together in waves throughout my entire body. I feel trapped, I can hardly move due to the motor confusion I am feeling. I am confused, and a little scared, but before I am able to tell myself I will be okay, things started to get back to normal. Eventually, the room I was in came back into focus, and I was able to burst out of the egg of grey triangle shapes I was living in. I was still holding the trashcan, all my friends were staring at me awkwardly, indicating to me I must have put on quite a show. None of them had taken more than one hit either, but I seemed to take the cake. I'm not sure how much I purged through the experience, but I'm sure it had happened more than the initial time. I washed my face and hands, and called it a night. Over and over again, I come back to the theme that this is not for recreational use. If someone is going to experiment with DMT, or any of its combinations, a person should take care to pay close attention to dosage, and take the process very seriously. Experimenting simultaneously with other people seems to produce no notable effects beyond the subjective experience each person has. Its possible the force field I was in was a manifestation of my previous notion, that DMT is not a social experience.

Experience:3 drops of cinnamon bark oil/ 5 drops of german chamomile oil/ 2mL of nutmeg oil in lecithin - experiments with nutmeg oil,"Anyways, in my experiments with nutmeg oil, I've used cinnamon bark oil (3-5 drops) and German chamomile oil (2-6 drops) both separately and together. It was always taken 30 minutes before nutmeg oil, and seems to significantly potentiate items effect and duration. The nature of the experience does not seem to be different, but with only 14 trials of nutmeg oil both with and without inhibitors, it is still hard to tell whether there is a change in the trip itself. The nutmeg was taken at doses ranging from 0.2mL to 1.5mL without inhibitors. 2mL of nutmeg oil with both inhibitors administered produced an intense out of body experience. The nutmeg was always taken with lecithin, with one exception; and usually at a week or more between doses. Occasionally I'd use one day, then the following day with diminished effects - almost certainly by tolerance. Five drops of nutmeg was administered once without lecithin. It gave a mild energizing effect as opposed to the stoning effect of taking it with lecithin. This dose was so low that not much else can be said. The out of body experience will be described below. I have past experience with cannabis (1 gram hash eaten, 1/8 ounce equivalent in cookies in one instance, many individual joints and bong hits), Psilocybin mushrooms (ranging from 1 gram to 4 grams eaten) and 4-AcO-DMT (10-25mg) at the time of taking the following. Before this experience, I had not had any drugs for over a month with the exception of the three oils, and occasional cannabis use. 3 drops of cinnamon bark oil, 5 drops of German chamomile oil, both encapsulated. This was followed exactly 30 minutes later by 1.5mL of nutmeg oil in lecithin, and an additional 0.5mL of nutmeg oil in lecithin approximately one hour after the first dose. By the first hour, a slight anxiety was building. I drank the second dose at that point. What followed was a slight increase in heart rate, and a mild tremor in my legs which only lasted about 5 minutes (this could be physiologically related to anxiety). Before the second hour passed my visual acuity had been tweaked, and colours became brighter than they usually are. Unnatural waving of the grass was noted and tracers became pronounced. My mind was profoundly altered soon after the second hour had passed, as I began to slip into a visionary state. The trees were breathing, as were the walls of my home - quite profoundly. There was morphing too, I noticed a lamp move as if it was made of a gelatinous sort of metal rather than the common metal I had always known it for. My stomach was overly stuffed with butterflies as I realized that soon, I would without a doubt break through to an unknown dimension. Here my window made strange geometric patters, they conveyed a different emotional state than that which is revealed from the geometry of psilocybin mushrooms. Everything in my vision began to melt, and in a minute my entire visual field was unrecognizable. The room had gone from constantly melting everywhere, to complete visual disconnection. In other words, my melting room produced tracers so great that I only saw the opaque artifacts which once was my room. And even they were disappearing as the tip of a shoe, or the hidden pattern of a curtain, a confused section of my bathrobe - all were consumed in the ever moving geometry, which had become extremely complicated as I laid in the small patch of carpet that the drug neglected to destroy, my anchor to reality. I felt - in the most indescribable way - my body being torn from me as I sensed the approach of The Other Side. A loud noise, which was an electric tone with a pitching shift, that went up. And up . . . and UP! And as the sound climaxed, a whooshing white noise did accompany it. Where is my carpet, my anchor? Now it was gone, and I was slipping, with nothing to hold me down. My body seemed fully disconnected now, and it's mind was gasping as a fish removed from water. We have arrived. What I saw on The Other Side is completely indescribable. I just cannot put it into words. This experience cannot be mimicked. I'll only say, that it was grand, and very powerful. Now on the way back home I soon sensed that I was vaguely returning, but to what? Oh of course, I was returning to my body! I had forgotten about bodies. And the universe! I am back on The Conventional Side. I had been home all along, laying on the carpet. Yet as I sat there on my carpet surrounded by morphing objects and slowly fading tracers, I thought about how completely batshit mad The Conventional Side really is, and already a new journey had begun, which at the time I did not know. I returned to a somewhat normal state by the eighth hour. Green tea was made and I was contemplating many things and their relationships. The tracers returned to their sober and unnoticeable positions soon after. It was around then that I began inhaling bong loads of Indican cannabis which brought on a new and idle introspection, that stayed with my until I had fallen asleep. And that's that! Nutmeg oil in lecithin is very smooth on the body. Some of the effects that are present include: a pleasurable high frequency vibration that began in the extremities and spread out to the entire body, AKA ""electric feels""; transient morphing bodily sensations, which is something I had never experienced in my life; an inability to stand, I was quite literally floored by the effects of the out of body experience, and in all other trials this effect is usually milder than that which is caused by alcoholic intoxication; there is an upward trend in heart rate at the first-second hour period, but it does not cause the heart to pound artificially like dopaminergics do. This is in my opinion, a mild cardiovascular effect potentiated greatly by my state of mind.

Experience:300mg DPH + 600mg DXM - An Interesting Combo,"The time range is approximate and could be wrong. This was my first time combining diphenhydramine with dextromethorphan. Dosage: 600 mg DXM in the form of powder (T+0:00) 300 mg DPH in the form of capsules (T+1:30) T+0:00 - 9:00PM - Took 600mg DXM hbr powder on an empty stomach. Planned on taking the DPH at around T+1:30. I put on some music and chatted to some friends over discord while waiting for the onset. T+0:50 - 9:50PM - Can feel the DXM onsetting, slight nausea and minor dissociation. At this point I started watching some TV so I could distract myself while waiting to come up. I think I was watching Gravity Falls but I could be wrong. T+1:30 - 10:30PM - At 10:30pm I decided to take the DPH. Decided on 300mg as I didn't want to trip too hard, at this point in time I had no idea how powerful the DXM+DPH combination was. I was feeling the DXM strong at this point, although I had not peaked. Swallowed the 6 x 50mg capsules with some water. The capsules had a weird taste. Wasn't very pleasant although the taste did not last long. T+2:00 - 11:00PM - 30 minutes after the I took the DPH capsules I started to feel some effects. I started to feel my mouth get dry and started feeling heavier than usual. Feel very tired but also very energetic, this was a pretty uncomfortable feeling. Nausea was still there. Passed pretty soon though. I decided to go back onto my computer. T+2:30-3:00 - 11:30PM-12:00AM - Both drugs had peaked. I don't know if it was just tolerance, but I couldn't feel the DXM as much as normal. This also could of been due to how strong the DPH was as we find out later. At this time I was drinking quite a lot of water as the dry mouth was pretty unpleasant. As soon as the DPH peaked I instantly started getting auditory hallucinations, this were pretty disturbing and I started feeling anxious so I put on some music to calm me down. My heart rate at this point was probably around 110++ BPM. A bit after I peaked I started to get some hallucinations. The first major one was some spiders on top of my roof. I've had spiders on DPH before so I wasn't too worried. I was fully lucid at this point. I was uncomfortable sitting at my computer because I felt so heavy so I decided to lie down on my bed. T+3:30-4:00 - 12:30AM-1:00AM - At this point the hallucinations really started. Shadow people kept appearing near my door and at the end of my bed. They would fade into thin air if I turned my phone light on or tried to walk over to them. I was getting some closed eyed visuals as well. When I closed my eyes I would see my room as if my eyes were open but everything would be extremely dull. There were a few minor differences but I can't remember the details. I was feeling extremely heavy when I tried to walk, like something was weighing me down. I still had dry mouth but it wasn’t as bad as before. Suddenly I heard my mum walking up the stairs and she knocked on the door. I decided to ignore this as I knew it was most likely a hallucination. I was correct, the noise stopped as soon as soon as I questioned if it was a hallucination. Around this time I started to hear voices. Light whispering from all directions which I could not make out. I heard this weird noise coming from outside so I decided to look out the window. There were people on my driveway doing construction. At the time this seemed normal, however it was 1 in the morning so this wasn't possible. I looked back in a few minutes and it was back to normal. T+4:00-5:00 - 1:00AM-2:00AM - I heard my mother walking up the stairs again like before. She knocked on the door like before but this time she opened it. I got worried so I pretended to act like I was asleep, she then did a circle and left my room. I was really confused but then I realized that it was most likely a hallucination. Around 1:30-2AM (I think) I started to get delirious. My ""mother"" came back and knocked on my door like normal and asked “Can I come in?”. This freaked me the fuck out as I wasn't expecting her to come in my room at 1AM. I quietly whispered “Yes” (it was hard to talk) and she then came in with a packet of pills, I quickly saw it was the DPH. My mum then said she was extremely disappointed in me for doing that to myself and that she found the pills in the trash, she then said we would talk about it in the morning and left. This is not possible as I didn't throw the pill packet in the trash and still had it in my bag. Also why would my mother be looking through the trash in the middle of the night. At the time I thought this was real and that I had been caught. I did not realize that it was a hallucination until a few hours later. T+5:00-6:00 - 2:00AM-3:00AM - Things got really weird at this point. I had a range of hallucinations such as my wall started to morph different directions and family/friends came into my room and we had various conversations which I would suddenly realize they were hallucinations, and then they would then just fade away. I also saw more shadow people. Another odd hallucination I had multiple times was my cat on my bed. I could pat her but after a while she just faded into thin air. I also had moments when I tried to pickup my phone and it would fade into thin air which I have had happen before at 600mg DPH. The delirium was very strong at points and it was hard to do anything. T+7:00 - 4:00AM - I heard my mum calling my name from downstairs, it sounded urgent. So I went downstairs calling her name, I ended up waking her up. She asked me why I was awake at 4 in the morning. I told her it was actually 6AM and I was getting ready for school (it was the weekend as well). She told me to go back to bed (she probably thought I was sleepwalking). I asked her if she was still mad at me. She replied with “why would I be mad at you?”. That was the point I finally realized that my mum never came upto my room before and it was just an extremely realistic hallucination. This really fucked with my head as I was sure that I had been caught before. I went back to my room and decided to get some sleep as I was not enjoying myself. I think I woke up a few times but ended up falling back to sleep straight away. The Day After: I woke up around 11AM feeling pretty terrible. Although I did have a slight DXM afterglow the effects were overpowered by the DPH hangover. I ended up asking my mum about what happened when I woke her up and she said I just looked and sounded confused. I ended up convincing her I was just sleep walking. Thankfully I didn't say anything too bad and was extremely lucky to not be caught. I underestimated this combination. Please be careful when doing diphenhydramine, especially in combination with DXM because of the unexpected strong synergy.

Keep in mind that my weight is high and the effects may not be as noticeable, especially at threshold doses. Currently, I am listening to the song ""Chromakey Dreamcoat"" by Boards of Canada (a really lovely ambient song c: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbfI4tV6Nvs), and will be partly throughout the experience. Substances: DXM, 50mL as per dosing cup. DPH / 8-chlorotheophylline (Dimenhydrinate) 100mg. Some grapefruit to (supposedly) inhibit the metabolism of DXM. 5:00 pm I decide to play one of my favorite games, ROBLOX. I start up with a general roleplaying game. I like to roleplay, you see. I wonder if I'll be any more creative. t+5 I felt some itching, but that quickly went by. I stop playing, because no one is actually roleplaying. I feel a chill run down me, which is common; these feelings of cold continue. I just finished eating a walnut and caramel Blizzard; pretty good. No more cold. t+10 I pause Chromakey Dreamcoat and decide to listen to Kitchen Nightmares vids while doing a ROBLOX Studio project. t+15 A cold, Raynaud's Phenomenon-type feeling sets into my hands. t+20 The coldness goes away. I eat some more yummy grapefruit. Applied hydrocortisone to my forehead cause it was itchy as fuck =^L Kenan responded to my question about how his name is pronounced. Cool. More grapefruitttt. t+30 I giggle at some comments on this video I feel more motivated and ""up."" I start to play that roleplaying game again Nothing seems to happen after this.

Experience:400mg DXM + 300mg DPH â Bacterial friends,"12:00 - take ~400mg worth of DXM gel caps. 12:30 - starting to feel first effects from the dex including nausea, take 300mg worth of Benadryl to counteract nausea. 1:30 - Nausea dissipated dex really coming up, put on some vaporwave and dance in my room. Cev's start, I see myself running off a pier into a busy river, I climb onto a boat and fight a pirate. I experience a couple changes in gravity, whenever I lay on my bed it feels as if I’m going to slide off. Like always on dex I’m feeling really happy and empathetic, I text a couple friends saying how I really appreciate them and they are good people. Head wise I’m pretty sober. 1:45 - Leave for my friend C's house. Arrive around 2. Benadryl visuals start to kick index is around the peak. 2:00 - As I arrive I walk around like an octopus in his yard until I make it into the house, there I hug his dog and am feeling the euphoria, previous to me arriving all my friends had been smoking some weed, and all are high. 2:15 - Around here time gets blurry until about 4:30. I go into his room where everyone else is, the lights are out and some music is playing from his Xbox, I wave my arms to the music and start getting some more cev's. I say how my couch has a mustache and eyes and is sad from being alone in the rain also I may have said I tried to have intercourse with it. My friend’s computer case starts to mix into the floor, hard to tell where one starts and the other begins, the ceiling and walls start to slide, the room becomes fogged. It’s very hard to talk clearly and I can barely stand on my own. My phone is coming increasingly hard to use, when I try to put in my passcode more buttons appear and disappear (today I’ve noticed that I renamed many of my folders one saying ""I am ready for…"", weird). After 2 friends emerge from making ramen I grab the box saying it’s my girlfriend Ashley and start trying to cuddle with it. After I wake from that trance I start to smoke imaginary cigarettes and my friends told me I began to rant about what I kept calling ""the spectacle"", eventually they ask me what I’m doing with my hands I say I’m smoking, they laugh and the cigarettes falls apart into these purple and green flouting bacteria that become common in the later parts of the trip. ~4:00 - I and C reemerge from his room, the bacteria clouds get bigger and become more common. I start to see people that aren't there; there now is a maid inside the kitchen cleaning the lights, she disappears a few minutes later. 4:30 - My dad picks me up and drives me to a robotics meeting, I don’t remember anything from the car ride. When I get to the meeting, I find more of the bacteria clouds, and the computer screens have 3d figures dancing inside them and start looking outside. ~6:00 - I’m out of the meeting and return home, still some bug clouds but I’m definitely coming down. I move my joystick around with my foot from under my desk, it looks like a gelatinous mass covered in the bacteria. I don’t remember much until around 11:00 when I saw some incredibly detailed cev's of what looked like a gravel road and puddle. Now I Schleep. Next day - Still feeling the afterglow with mild euphoria and slight cev's occasionally I can see some of the bacteria and some visual snow/static if I look at something long enough, and my motor control is a tad off but overall pretty sober. I'd say a 8.5/10 trip, next time, which probably won’t be for a couple weeks, I’m either taking more Benadryl or a medium dose of lsd.

Experience:DXM & DPH in combination,"So I heard about this combination a few times before, and always thought it was an interesting concept. The DXM and DPH are supposed to be very synergistic, producing effects that neither have on their own. (Extremely vivid CEVs, OEVs, etc.) I'll admit, I was always kind of skeptical. I had tried both before, typically hitting the 3rd plateau with DXM and never going above 400mg of DPH, because enhanced music is cool, but hearing voices and talking to people who aren't there... not so much. Despite my skepticism, I was VERY curious . Last night, I finally decided to try it out. I swallowed 20 of those disgusting DXM gel caps (15mg each x 20 250mg DPH). Keep in mind these are relatively low doses for both drugs. After my stomach settled (I'm a bit of a bitch when it comes to swallowing large quantities of pills) I sat down and got started on some work. About 45 minutes into typing, I started to notice that it was turning into a bit of a challenge to type. My vision was difficult to focus and my fingers felt really sluggish - almost like my keyboard was submerged in a tub of maple syrup and I had to dip my hands in it to type or something. I figured this would be a good time to stop typing out my essay. I stood up and recognized that familiar ""floaty"" feeling you get in your head on DXM. It was still easy to keep my balance though. At this point, I was feeling really good. All smiles, I walked around the house, just enjoying how awesome it felt to walk around. Everything was just... floaty. I don't know how to describe it, but rest assured it was fucking awesome. I went outside to take a piss in the backyard and looked up at the stars as I drained my bladder. Before I could take it all in, I suddenly realized I was pissing in my fucking backyard. Why was I pissing in my backyard? I didn't really fight it though because it felt awesome. When I was done, I looked at the stars again. They were brighter than usual. After staring at them for a while, all the stars started to feel like they were REALLY close. It felt like they were marble-sized and only a few feet away. It was such a convincing feeling that I had to reach out and try to touch them. I didn't reach. I looked at the side of my house and all the panels on the side looked like they were melting and swirling around. Again, it was SO convincing that I had to walk up and touch the side of my house just to make sure it didn't really turn into a big liquid blob. To my relief, it was indeed solid. The coolest thing I noticed, at this point, was the fact that I felt nearly 100% sober in my head. My motor skills were off and I was seeing things, but in my head I felt totally clear. I was starting to get cold so I did a few jumping jacks and went inside. It was really dark inside the house, but wherever there was a bit of light (like the little green light on a computer monitor or the little red light on the fire extinguisher), I would see swirls of color seeping out of it. Like they were leaking out. It looked exactly like the rainbow you see on the surface of puddles outside when motor oil gets dripped in them. Again, I had to touch it. Again, normal. At this point, I was close to the peak of the trip. This is when I get a visit from none other than my cat, Jeff. I heard him meow and quickly spun around to pet him. It was so amazing. He felt like my little buddy and I wanted to go on an adventure with him so I picked him up and took him to my room. I really had to pee again though, so I dropped him off at my room and then went to the bathroom. As soon as my urine hit the surface of the water, I swear the water changed all different colors, as if I was pouring paint into the water, not piss. I wished I could pee for longer. Upon returning to my room, I noticed that Jeff ditched me. So I decided to hop in bed and see what happens. This is the peak of my trip. As soon as I looked up at the ceiling, it turned into an enormous snow-covered mountain. It was so fucking clear I couldn't believe my eyes. I saw avalanches, skiers, trains and everything. I remember thinking ""How the fuck is my brain even doing this?!"" All the snow was swirling around slowly and beautifully. Every single surface I looked at told a different story. The floor looked like a desert, the walls looked like an ocean, and all kinds of other shit. My favorite part of the trip, though, was when I closed my eyes. When I closed my eyes, it felt like they weren't really closed. The visuals were so realistic that it felt like my eyes were still open, except I was looking at a different world. I looked over my bed (with my eyes closed, mind you) and saw that I was teetering on the edge of an enormous cliff. I wasn't scared though, because I still felt relatively sober and knew it was just a visual. I also kept going into this weird dream state where I would talk to old friends and family, only to realize that they weren't really there, and I wasn't really talking. Almost like a really short dream (while I was awake) One more phenomenon I noticed was that I often confused random shapes for objects that weren't really there. For instance, when I lifted the lid to the toilet, I saw the little hole at the bottom of the bowl and I thought it was my phone for a second. And I saw my shoes on the ground as my cat. I didn't even realize it was shoes until I petted them. Goofy things like that. I kept switching back and forth between ""closed eye world"" and ""open eye world"", trying to decide which one I liked best. They were both so incredible I just decided to open/close my eyes in 30 second intervals so I could enjoy both. That's the last thing I remember before going to sleep. I woke up this morning, still a little cloudy from the DXM, but highly impressed by what these two substances could do together on a pretty low dose. You can easily buy 300mg of DXM and 250mg DPH for under ten bucks at your local drug store and try it out yourself. I'm curious to see if anybody else had an experience like this. I was NOT expecting such vivid visuals. TL;DR I'm no expert, but I'd say this is a very solid combination; 8.5/10 Submitted by Wispy for /u/nicnar","['acuity suppression', 'colour shifting', 'disinhibition', 'drifting', 'external hallucination', 'internal hallucination', 'magnification']",1454
Experience:40x Extract - Bastard Wizard and his miserable little witch,"""I could see a witch and wizard (I smoked the salvia through a wizard-shaped bong)"" 1st time with salvia divinorum – 40x potency, two bowls On my first try I didn’t manage to get anywhere, though I felt my body gripped with a high of sorts and became giddy and found everything very funny. On my second try I was still not convinced that I had done it properly/taken enough – I was expecting what little visuals I had to be more DMT-like. Instead, there was a grey fuzziness and nothing was distinct. I felt iron fingers all over my body, and when I closed my eyes and sat back the fingers gripped me and were dragging me in an arch out of this world and into the Other. I felt like I was moving backwards and sideways, with the final destination (back inside my body) in sight. This way, I could visualise how long the salvia was going to last. But I was also worried about going backwards too far, in case I didn’t come back... When I was in the Otherworld, I could see a witch and wizard (I smoked the salvia through a wizard-shaped bong), made out of the grey, fuzzy, non-descript visuals (think TV static). There could have been more of them but I can’t be sure. They were telling me, in sinister voices, “You will die. You will ruin everything and take your friends with you.” I was frightened, and could imagine the police coming and arresting us all, and it all being my fault (though I knew that salvia is legal in the UK). I prematurely ended the trip by opening my eyes, standing up, and walking away from the bong. That was it, nothing more, though it did set The Fear in me which stayed for the beginning of my ayahuasca trip later that day.

Experience:20x Extract - a tall humanoid figure wearing a white cloak,"A little more than three years ago, I was hanging out with some friends and the topic of Salvia came up. A couple of my friends, who were younger than me, had smoked it before. At the time I had been smoking cannabis regularly for two years and also had experiences with psilocybin mushrooms, dextromethorphan, and diphenhydramine. I knew that Salvia was much more intense than almost any other substance, but I had to see it for myself. One friend's (""friend B"") description of his trip made me decide to buy some; he said every time he laughed, his head felt like it was made of pieces of Lego which were falling apart. This intrigued me. We went to our local headshop and I purchased one gram of 20x Salvia Divinorum. It came in a plastic Ziploc bag with a sticker-label on it, and the stuff looked like crushed spider-legs. The girl behind the counter gave her mandatory spiel about using it in a safe environment, with a trip sitter, etc., but as you will read later we didn't exactly follow her instructions. After procuring the Salvia, the four of us headed to our friend's house nearby. We'll call him ""friend A"". Our biggest problem: Friend A's mother was an addictions counselor and wouldn't be pleased with us smoking dissociatives in her basement. Thankfully, via some sort of kismet she had plans to go see a movie, so we sat on the couch and packed a bowl of Salvia mixed with a bit of weed into a bong while we waited for her to leave. Soon enough, we heard the front door open and her car pulled out of the driveway; we were good-to-go. since I'd paid for the Salvia I had dibs on the first bowl. I pulled slowly and deeply, making sure to burn the whole bowl. My friends stared with bated breath. I held the smoke in for about 5 seconds then exhaled, which elicited gasps of dismay from two friends. ""You're supposed to hold it in man, now it probably won't work"", they advised. However, within a few seconds, I could see things beginning to change; my friends' faces looked like some kind of blurry plasticine. I sunk into the couch and clutched its armrest with anticipation. They could see my expression changing quickly, and remarked that I was obviously starting to trip. I looked at the TV across the room and was shocked that I could see the entire TV. It was like I could see all six sides of the TV unfolded before me, including its wiry innards. My mouth gaped as I took all of this in. Friend C (A's sister) abruptly tried to grab a sweater I had been sitting on. When I felt the tug under me, I looked down. The space between the sweater and the couch was a void. A deep, black void that wanted to suck me in. I clutched the sweater into my arms and tried to stretch it back over the void. ""I need this!"" I hissed. She laughed awkwardly and remarked that she was cold, but didn't try to take the sweater. And then suddenly, I heard a familiar sound. Like the slamming of wood and metal, but I couldn't understand it. Then, from out of the six-dimensional TV, came a woman's voice. It shouted my Friend A's name and I saw my friends reel with terror. I realized that was not a hallucination; my friend's addiction-counsellor mom came home. ""Fuck! What's she doing home so early!?"" Friend A remarked. Then I stupidly decided to try to speak, ""But... she can't yet. I'm on the... the thing. Um. Salvia."" I mumbled flatly. I heard the basement door open. ""Shut up! Don't say that word! Fuck, man!"" Friend B hissed. I tried to process this. ""But... I'm... Salvia."" I retorted. Upon hearing her footsteps and voice in the basement, it clicked in my head that speaking was not going to help me. I continued staring at the TV (which was off the whole time). Friend A's mother sniffed the air. ""It smells down here... have you been smoking in here, A?"" Waves of trepidation. Every word she said seemed to come out of the TV, although she was actually behind me. Thankfully A had not smoked yet and had prepared an excuse, ""No I was burning incense. I mean, that's obviously not the smell of cigarettes or anything, right?"" A stroke of genius; how would she know what Salvia smelled like? His mother glanced us all over. I continued staring into the morphing TV, refusing to make eye contact. After a few uncomfortable moments, she remarked that she had forgotten her wallet and was now late for her movie. She hurriedly left the house and we all sighed in relief. My visuals started to subside. We waited for a few minutes to calm down, then packed another bowl. This time it was Friend C's turn, at 16 she was the youngest of us all and I don't think she had experience with anything other than cannabis and alcohol. Therefore, we packed her a comparatively smaller bowl. Having seen my mistake, she knew to hold the smoke in until the effects started. Within seconds of smoking, I saw her eyes well with tears and an uncomfortable grin spread across her face. She laid back in her seat and put her hands in the air as if she was on a rollercoaster. Soon, she was laughing so hard she was crying. It sounded like she was trying to speak but could not stop laughing, she was in complete hysterics. We all watched and laughed along with her as she screamed with laughter. Within a few minutes, she was wiping the tears from her face and explaining that she actually was on a rollercoaster, and ice cream cones were the passengers. She couldn't elaborate more than that. This seemed like a very light-hearted and fun trip compared to what I had seen with the TV. In light of her hilarious trip, I decided I would re-try. I packed the bottom of the bong with weed, then filled the rest with Salvia and sprinkled a bit more weed on top for flavor. Looking back, I think I put about 1/4 of the gram into that bowl. I cooked the bowl much faster this time since I was aware of just how short the bioavailability really is. I held the acrid smoke in and saw the same plasticine-face effect as my friends looked at me. But this time there was a very strong rush. It felt ominous and there seemed to be a ""woosh"" sound, like when one puts one's ear to a seashell. I could tell this was going to be intense, and once again I laid back and clutched the couch. Then blackness. I opened my eyes, to see that I was standing on the edge of a plateau. The ground beneath me was powdery and orange-red, like Mars. The clear sky was a similar color, but more reddish. There were wisps of white clouds, but not many. I took a few steps toward the edge of the cliff. Far below me was a vast orange desert-badlands sort of area. The ground was cracked and dry. I heard the woosh again and looked upward; several creatures were flying overhead. They were shaped like manta rays with very long dragon-like tails. They were dark shades of purple and blue, with bumpy leathery scales. I spoke their name, which to the best of my recollection was something like ""Quixocitolix"" (no, not Quetzalcoatl). It was as though I had seen these creatures before. They did not seem dangerous, but they were worthy of my respect and appreciation. I made my way down the steep cliff-face and into the badlands. With the creatures flying overhead, and a vast plain before me, I walked for what felt like two years. I felt myself age and grow weary but I did not stop walking. Eventually, I reached a small white hut. It was somewhat like a mushroom; fat, short and round with a wider dome-like roof. It had a rounded entrance with no door and seemed very welcoming. I don't recall entering the hut, but my next memory is inside the hut. Everything was stark white. When I looked around I could not see an exit, despite the fact the entrance had no door. Behind a white rectangular counter stood a tall humanoid figure wearing a white cloak. It was like a burka, I could not see the figure's face. I slowly approached the counter. The figure finally acknowledged my presence with a laugh. ""So... what do you think?"" Its voice was neither masculine nor feminine. It simply spoke English words, in their truest form, with no special voicing or accent. Despite that, it seemed to have an echo. I stammered ""What? Think of what?"" It laughed very loudly and mockingly. ""The Salvia! What do you think of Salvia?"" I reeled with confusion. Salvia? This word seemed so familiar. I tried to recall how I had gotten into this room, and briefly remembered smoking with other humans in a small room. I could not remember my friends' names or faces. The humanoid was aware of my confusion, it seemed to thrive on it. I gained momentary confidence and tried to voice my opinion on Salvia. But I could not use my mouth. The cloaked figure focused on me even more intently and began laughing louder and louder. It knew I could not speak. I felt a physical barrier between my words and my mouth. I raised my hands to the corners of my mouth and pushed forward. As I moved the block-like barrier, I heard my answer escape from my mouth; ""NO!"" The creature's eyes widened and I saw the hut-room rocket away from me; when I pushed the barrier away from myself, I had seemingly pushed myself into the realm of that ""block"". I looked at the block I had pushed off of my mouth, it was labeled with the word ""No"", the same word I had been trying to say. It was about arm-length away from me, and when I looked around I could see other similar blocks with different words on them. It slowly started to move away, and it appeared to be a wall of keyboard-like blocks, all with different words or ideas. I started to float backward, faster and faster. It wasn't a wall, it was a floor. No. It wasn't a floor, it was a plain. My mind reeled as I tried to take in all the ideas on these blocks. As I floated away I saw the full scope of the block-wall; it was a planet. I screamed. A planet made of thoughts, ideas, and words, all arranged like a keyboard. I was still floating away from the planet, into the blackness of space. ""NO NO NO NO NO!"" I continued to scream endlessly, to no avail. Then it occurred to me, if I pushed the planet away by saying the wrong word, perhaps I could get back to it by answering the white humanoid's question properly. I shouted out loud my answer to its question, I could not hear my own voice but I felt my mouth moving. Then I felt the gravity of the planet pull me back in, and I heard that familiar whoosh. I had reconnected to the ideas that made up my reality. For a few brief moments, I felt as though I was waking from a deep sleep. There was a blur of colors as I opened my eyes, and the basement slowly started to fade in. I recognized the people sitting around me, they all looked very sedate. I turned to Friend B, who was sitting next to me on the couch. His eyes were half-open and I could tell he was still under the effects of Salvia. It occurred to me that I had been speaking while tripping, but I couldn't remember those ""magic words"" I had said to bring me back to reality. I asked my friends, still somewhat slurred and hazy, ""What did I just say?"" They turned to me abruptly, apparently, they hadn't realized I was sober again. ""What do you mean?"", they asked. ""When I was tripping I was speaking. What did I say?"" Friend A replied, ""Well you spent most of the time screaming your fucking head off which wasn't cool."" His disapproval seemed inane since I didn't even know I was on the same planet as him, let alone in the same room. ""But at the end, you looked really serious and shouted ""OH GOD WHAT IS THIS I DON'T EVEN""."" I broke out in laughter. Those were my ""magic words""? Well, it did seem to sum up the Salvia experience pretty well, and I suppose it appeased whatever part of my mind was represented by that cloaked figure. I asked my two male friends what they saw since I already knew what C had seen because she tripped before me. Friend A told me that all the walls seemed to ""peel back"" to reveal a layer of streaming numbers beneath. I suppose you could compare that to The Matrix. Friend B, despite being the largest of us all, had a particularly low tolerance for most drugs I had seen him take. He regularly ""tripped out"" when smoking weed, in his own words. This low tolerance seemed to factor into his Salvia experience because he said it was very intense but he also could not remember anything. After stepping outside for some fresh air, I managed to slowly recall my entire trip and recounted it to my friends. They seemed hesitant to believe that I could have seen so much in only ten minutes, but I reminded them that I had smoked much more than they had. All-in-all, despite the overwhelming intensity and the ensuing HPPD which I have been living with, I look back on this trip fondly. It was certainly a breakthrough, and the most intense trip I have experienced to date. The fact that it felt like two years in the span of ten minutes is mind-boggling. I tried to smoke the rest of the Salvia a few weeks later with a friend, but neither of us experienced anything. I would consider doing Salvia again, but only in a much more controlled environment, and with sober trip-sitters.

"Experience:Cannabis (50-75mg, Edible) - OEV's","Background At the time of dose, I had low to moderate experience using cannabis and low tolerance. No previous experience with any other psychedelics or substances. This was the first time I ever made what I call ""the classic"" inexperienced mistake of eating more of an edible before the first dose kicked in. At the time, I was fairly new to using cannabis (as were my friends who were present) and not entirely familiar with the ins and outs of its use - having mostly used 25mg edibles provided by friends on about a monthly basis. Experience I was together with good friends at their house where we had done weed a decent amount of times. It was a day or two before I would be taking a long road trip with someone, and I wanted to introduce my travel buddy to cannabis for the first time. So, we gathered around in the living room to eat some edibles, play games and munch on snacks. (+0:00) Consumed 50mg or so of THC brownie and began playing card games with my group of friends. (+0:45) Decided to eat about 25mg more. (+1:00) At this point, myself and my group of friends begin laughing uncontrollably with the giggles. We also begin eating our snacks due to ""the munchies"". My travel buddy, who had also consumed about as much THC as I had (their first time), began to feel overwhelmed and we decided to have her lay down. She begins hearing voices, cannot speak well and really has to go to the bathroom. My other friends begin to help her to the bathroom as I sit back on the couch and start to space out, couch-locked. (+1:10) As I am spacing out on the couch, I start to feel a strong falling sensation (hypnic jerks) as I lay down. I sit up, and begin to feel a swirling sensation in my head. This feels intense, like I have been dizzy from spinning in a circle. The swirling sensation begins to stabilize into a swirling visual manifestation. Then shapes seem to emerge from this swirl. The swirling turns into shapes which seem to be a combination of Shipibo patterns with the movement of a screensaver. They are zoomed-out and take up only part of my vision. The colors are mostly dull/black and white and the pattern moves back and forth in a fairly rapid fashion. As I experience this, I notify my friends (who are still dealing with my travel buddy). The experience feels intense in my head, and I am a bit nauseous, but am enjoying the novelty of what I am seeing. The visuals are much less pronounced when I close my eyes than when my eyes are open. The experience takes up my entire focus and is mostly ""intense"" feeling. I'd describe it as somewhat dysphoric, but not anxiety-inducing (I am a generally calm and cool-headed person, so YMMV). (+1:15) Now it is just me in the room and the visuals are subsiding to what feels like a typical THC high experience. (+1:20) My friends and I attend to my travel buddy, who has a bad time (including speaking in different languages, acting unlike herself and not being able to speak much at times). She was fine after the experience though. I believe my experience with OEV's was predominately a product of taking a very heavy dose of edibles (11-hydroxy-THC) with low to no tolerance at the time, though some anxiety from my travel buddy's situation may also have played a part to a lesser-extent. The fact that the edibles were (chocolate) brownies may have also played a role to make the experience enhanced and/or substance more bioavailable.

Experience:An experiement combining mangoes and cannabis,"In order to verify the potentiation section of PsychonautWiki's cannabis article, I decided to buy six mangoes at the grocery store and attempt to eat as many as I could. I would then vaporize cannabis and note down the differences that I notice. I began my experiment at 8:00PM and cut up and ate as many mangoes as I could. I stopped at 8:20PM after eating four mangoes total due to feeling too sick to continue any further and set a timer on my phone to go off in one hour. I could not see myself doing this daily since it made my stomach feel a bit upset and I feared that I would grow sick of the taste of mangoes after a while. However, it was a worthy experience and one of the best, most euphoric experiences that I have had with cannabis in quite some time due to my high tolerance. I noticed that my usual dosage for cannabis went down and I was, for the first time in a while, too high to continue smoking anymore after vaping two bowls total. This is a large difference compared to the three bowls that I usually smoke. I also noticed that the effects were more euphoric in general. I experienced physical euphoria and spontaneous bodily sensations while listening to music as well as personal meaning enhancement to the specific lyrics in the songs, which is one of my favorite effects to experience on weed. I experienced analysis enhancement and thought about my place in the universe and thought about my family a lot, which also happens to me frequently when on psychedelics but less often weed.

Experience:Citalopram 10 mg and Cannabis 7 hits,"A little backstory; a few days ago, I smoked a huge bowl all at once and waited so little between hits I got depersonalization and derealization with extreme anxiety and paranoia; went to the hospital. :T. However, citalopram is supposed to counter or help anxiety if it happens. I'm waiting 20 minutes (instead of 5-10 like I did in the ER trip) between every hit if I smoke more than one (I have like three tiny little budlet thingies in a foil-pen setup). Fun fact; that was the first time I went to the hospital. They also gave me naloxone because, ""there's no harm in it and it might help."" Plus, the ER guys were nice and not assholes, didn't threaten police (Cannabis is schedule I in my state) or anything. Yes, they tested for synthetic cannabinoids and only found marijuana constituents (THC, CBD, cannabinol, etc.) I think the strain was sativa and it still is. t+000 (07:04 PM) Citalopram 10 mg taken; waiting 40 minutes for cannabis so citalopram can take effect to fuck any anxiety (not likely, very small weed amount) over. I go take a piss with my laptop and charger. t+010 I actually gotta shit. and piss. a shitpiss. (Comments under the comment are ones that take place about 5 mins after) I'm listening to this video t+~130 FINALLY took a hit of weed. Listening to this video. I'll do a video timeline I guess. Before so, I didn't really see any citalopram effects other than being less sad kind of? Also anxiety gone. Video t+~145 Video I'm really excited. :D I'm waiting about 15-30 minutes between each hit and no more than 5 if not spaced right to avoid anxiety and derealization, btw. t+~175 I get some ramen and toast with peach preserves and butter...SOOOOOOOO DAMN GOOD OH MY GOD :D oooo i FEEL WARM :D It's like - oh my god I just got a tickle in my cheeks :D Tickles everywhere and oh my god I'm so warm and tingly c: Screw video timeline and oh my god I feel so good. Carefreeeeeeeeeee. Ahhh. :D I'm also playing this game throughout and also listening to this guy's channel t+~200 I laugh a lot at the background video ;D A bit of head pressure/pain. Huh. t+~209 Another hit; fuck, doesn't work. Gotta replace the foil on my pen pipe. :T t+~223 Third hit. Not sure if it was successful because I felt no smoke...doing again. Alright, even if it wasn't successful, I'll quit until an hour in. t+~240 Listening to this because the instrumentals are good. I fuck off with that and go to Hewkii's Next Time I say ""fuck it"" and take the last smonk of vede for the trip. Oh, piss on it, I can't get it to smonk right! I fill the bowl a bit bigger... alright, now the hit (11:51 PM) Now I did it. Switched to videos here: [1], [2] t+~300 (0:00 AM) OH FUCK MAN I FEEL THE SAME AS I DID IN THE HOSPITAL D: Just kidding :) oooh chills ;o more :D t+~305 Now I take a hit that actually seems to produce visible smoke from my lungs. Niiiice. t+~375 One more and last hit. About 45-60 mins ago I stopped listening to music/videos, will listen again. Also I'm gonna mention I ate some mint ice cream. Well, nothing else is gonna happen, bros. I'm gonna end this trip report. Conclusion: If you are prescribed SSRIs, use cannabis around the same time as them and as long you think, ""I'll be ok"" and take a light-med dose you good.

Experience:300mg Cannabis Unity,"3:45pm - Before I left my house, I packed a pipe with roughly 300mg of cannabis indica. It's about an hour drive, and I smoked about half the bowl. 5:15pm - Having spent about a half hour at my destination, got back in my car, and set out for home. I continued smoking along the way. 5:45pm - About halfway through my drive home I was thinking about mindfulness meditation, what I was doing in the current moment, and why I was driving home. I didn't need to be home for any particular reason, it was just the place I go when I don't need to be somewhere else. My sense of self briefly transformed to be the entire region in which I'd been traveling, which was currently putting away one of its resources. The illusion of agency was briefly broken as I was a small part of a larger system. After a moment I became lost in thought again and returned to a normal sense of self. Conclusion It seems rare to encounter unity and interconnectedness with cannabis alone. I've been practicing meditation and reflecting on the Buddhist concept of non-self for a few months, as well as contemplating the neuroscience of free will. Further experimentation will be required to determine if this was a drug experience or meditative experience. Most likely a bit of both. I'm encouraged by Oskykin's report that unity is achievable without the assistance of drugs. Submitted by Maethor1337","['perception of predeterminism', 'unity and interconnectedness']",306
Experience:3 bowls of cannabis indica - I wrote down unintelligible gibberish,"""Okay well what should I do about the thing?"" ""I feel warm and happy""""I see red lines [in] my [field] of vision"" Background Before I started school two months ago, I was a heavy cannabis smoker, having a routine and lighting up at the same time every single night. Once my program started, I noticed myself smoking less often, due to the heavy coursework demands. For the past three weeks, I was engaged in an intense anatomy and physiology course. I had finished my final exam and decided to get high to celebrate my epic marks. Seeing as I haven't smoked in three weeks, I expected my high to be an intense one. 11:45 pm. I packed the first bowl into my new pipe and took a hit. I was texting my friend and told her I was already feeling the effects. At 11:50, I packed and smoked two more bowls, then cleaned up and put away my stash. Experience Several minutes passed since I took the last hit, and by midnight, the effects became prominent. I felt a wave of heavy calmness and sedation wash over me. I started to hear a ringing sound in my ears; when I'm high on cannabis, that ringing sound is the signal that I'm peaking and about to trip. I closed my eyes and became overwhelmed at the loudness of my brain. Behind closed eyes and within my ""loud brain"", I tripped out hardcore. I felt like I was spinning. My body tingled all over and I had a subtle sense of euphoria. My thought processes made absolutely no sense to me. I was on my phone and felt like I wasn't in control of my thumbs. For some reason, I opened up a notetaking app and started to type random phrases, letters, words, and just plain gibberish. A lot of the text I typed was from my keyboard's auto-correction/auto-prediction feature, but mostly I was trying to put down my unsober thoughts and make sense of what was happening in my mind. I stared at the screen and saw red lines running down my phone. I had this encompassing feeling of warmth and happiness. When I'm high, my mind creates scenarios and visualizations partially based on my experiences and encounters with people and the world around me. While in this incredibly hazy state of mind, eyes closed, I envisioned myself in this dream-like world. I was with this being who told me to dance. The being's ""body"" consisted of geometric and colorful patterns. I danced as my surroundings swirled and spiraled around me. Everything became distorted, and I suddenly slipped and my world collapsed inwards. At that moment, I physically jerked back to awareness and consciousness. I opened my eyes, mind still foggy, and thought about what just happened.

Experience:Psychedelic Experience on Cannabis - Meeting Zeus,"Preface - I'm an everyday smoker recently coming off a t-break. This was my 7th day back from the break. I didn’t have a whole lot of weed. Enough for 4 or 5 decent sized bowls. Probably smoked 1.5 grams in total. I had the intention of getting very high. I really enjoy psychedelic drugs, and recently saw a post about turning cannabis into a psychedelic by focusing your mind. Throughout the session, I continued to tell myself to get higher. I affirmed it in my brain. I said “You will get so high, you will be overwhelmed”. I’d heard that you can get higher by just taking bigger hits, so I took a huge hit off a glass spoon pipe.Waited. Packed a fat bong and took massive rips. Waited. Vaped a bowl off the arizer, all the while maintaining this “get high as fuck” mindset. Well, I began climbing the ladder. I went from happily buzzed, to nice and stoned, to quite stoned, to really high. From really high (probably [7]) I know if I’m getting super stoned if I get a sort of 3D clear edge effect. I didn’t get that at all. I sat at a [7] for around 4 minutes or so, mildly disappointed that I couldn’t get higher. Either weed or my body acknowledged my disappointment, and suddenly I was skyrocketed. I began to see a large God-like figure in the corner of my vision. I assumed it was God. The being had a zooming like feature to it. Psychonaut wiki’s definition describes it perfectly. “ Images can switch between each other via the experience of one's vision zooming into or out from the current image to such an extent that it reveals an entirely new image.” The God-like figure seemed to come from within me. Finally, after being fascinated by this God-like figure, I began to realize who it was. It was Zeus! He had grey hair, and bright orange eyes (I smoked tangerine strain..Maybe that had something to with the color?). This being looked similar to something that my friend and I had seen in a park many years. Some being with grey hair and orange eyes was crouched beside a small brick building in a park. We we’re on the swings and both acknowledged it’s existence..and proceeded to run like hell. Zeus was a very large humanoid figure. He was against a darker background, emphasizing his existence all the much more. This lasted for around 5-10 minutes of him coming from inside me and staring somewhat judgmentally at me. During this time, I had an INTENSE body buzz. I could hardly move. My eyes felt incredibly heavy, and hurt to look at the computer screen. I rested my head on my desk and closed my eyes looking at the floor. Eventually, the heaviness faded, as did Zeus. He was no longer coming in and out of my vision, though his orange eyes often stared into me from my peripheral vision of my left eye. IT seemed as if he wasn’t happy that I wasn’t leaving. He seemed to have something to tell me, and due to my lack of weed, I wouldn’t be able to hear it. Submitted by Wispy","['internal hallucination', 'spontaneous tactile sensations']",685
Experience:Unknown dose - Supermarket dislocation and biking,"It was the second time I used a cannaboid. My friend prepared it and therefore I do not know the exact composition and dosis (although I heard afterward that he uses relative high doses). I and my friends (three persons in total) inhaled the Cannabis using a bong. In total I inhaled four or five times. The effects did not kick in inmediatly, I started feeling it around 20 minutes later. I was in a supermarket. We were walking at the soda department of the supermarket. Suddenly I felt, what I would describe as a knock, in my head. A sudden realization that has no depth/context/meaning, but rather a moment of reset. I felt disorientated, unknown of my surroundings but in control of my motor skills and I recognized my friends. Whilst I had control over my body my mind was in panic. I visualized that the whole supermarket solely consisted of the soda department. After this realization my consciousness panicked too. My persona panicked and I wanted to leave the supermarket. However, I was not able to do so on my own. My mind thought that the building I was in had no exit. I needed to be brought outside by a friend. We biked further, and around 45 minutes after inhalation the effects slowly faded away. A car passed us and I sensed the car in a drifting motion. This was the last noted effect, other than euphoria and appetite, which lasted for around two more hours.

Experience:Creative Bliss,"Background All my life I've been dealing with procrastination, especially concerning writing. I come from a family of writers and have always been creative, but found myself starting to make real progress by combining marijuana with my writing sessions. Experience I'm very creative while high. It's a double edged sword really. When I try to meditate (samatha style) while high, and really be aware of my thoughts, something interesting happens. My thoughts become much more abstract, seemingly constantly shifting frames of reference while connecting ideas from normally (to me at least) distinct domains of knowledge (but maybe I'm full of shit on that last part). But on the other hand I'm more inebriated, and the effect isn't nearly as prominent as it is on LSD or a heavier psychedelic. My thoughts seem to become 'elongated', and very fleeting. I often times feel like I have a good epiphany only to forget it later, like I begin forgetting the thought almost as soon as it finishes. But if I loop the thought in my mind long enough to get it down on paper, it usually turns out to be something pretty profound. Or at least a very detailed plot thread for my writing. I'm not just more creative, but the part of me that is too self-critical to write a rough draft is stifled. The soothing effects of marijuana help me focus and just get things down. And they're usually not half-bad, if not a little inebriated. The downside is that other aspects of my cognition are significantly decreased, but at least I haven't found myself going delusional. Someone please let me know if that happens.

Experience:Kratom + Phenibut + Cannabis - Warm Bliss,"After having performed a successful initial test of kratom earlier in the day, in which I took 5 g and then redosed 2 g for a total of 7 g. It was fun, and was a good introduction to this fun powdered plant. Preparations 8 g of powdered kratom were added to a small amount of cold water, and without filtration or heating, were ingested orally. About 0.5 g of phenibut HCl coarsely powdered crystals were ground into a finer powder to make insufflation easier. t+0:00 (22:30) - I ingested 8vg kratom, then pulverized 0.5 g of phenibut HCl and insufflated four lines about 100 mg each. t+0:15 (22:45) - I felt a slight stimulating and relaxing buzz from the phenibut. t+0:30 (23:00) - I felt a warm feeling beginning to surround my body; the kratom was beginning to take effect. t+1:00 (23:30) - At this point the insufflated phenibut and kratom are both reaching a peak, so I go outside to smoke some cannabis on my roof. I feel hot even though it is cold outside, and do not have to wear my jacket. After smoking I went upstairs to my bed and began to feel a gentle, yet all-encompassing warmth, almost a tingling in my body accompanied by itches. The euphoria was more physical than cognitive, but during the onset and peak there were waves of gentle cognitive euphoria, in which I felt a sense of wellbeing and generally good. There was intense music appreciation, but my thoughts were free to wander away from the music and I could either pay attention to it or think about other things. My thoughts were disorganized, and I thought about random things that were mostly unrelated to each other, yet at times there was an odd and seemingly sensible transition between these unrelated thoughts. Nicotine was extremely pleasurable in this state. t+1:30-3:14 (00:00-01:45) - During this period of time I was in a nod-like state, in which I was extremely sedated almost to the point of sleep, yet I was slightly awake and listening to loud grunge music mostly, although I remember no details from this period. I had some imagery, such as a flying bird that I was looking down at. I do not remember what other imagery I saw, but I do not remember them. A call from my friend brought me out of this state, and I remember being slow and sounding fucked up on the call. t+5:00 (03:30) - I insufflated thee more lines of phenibut, and went back out to my roof to smoke some cannabis. I felt mostly sober other than a small amount of phenibut I still could feel, and 15 minutes after taking the lines of phenibut I began to feel their effects. t+6:00 (04:30) - I feel calm and have a slight headache, but do not feel any nausea or other ill effects.

Experience:Clonazolam + 2-methyl-AP-237 (unknown dosage) - Cardiac arrest,"My last memory is me streaming on clonazolam. I wake up at the local hospital, tied to the bed. I have severe pain in my chest area. It is the middle of the night and i have no idea why I am here. Eventually a nurse is arriving and asks me if I feel alright, but the only thing I want to know is the reason I am here. She tells me, the chief doctor is on his way. He arrived with his assistants a few minutes later. ""Did you do it on purpose?"" ""What do you mean by 'it'?"" ""Your suicide."" ""What suicide? What happened?"" One of his assistants tells me that I have been found dead and needed to be resuscitated. I am nerve-wracked. ""How dead?"" ""We can't tell you, you're the only one who knows what you've taken."" But I don't know it myself at this moment. I don't want to believe all this. Slowly tags of memories start to reassemble. I remember dripping clonazolam on my tongue like a maniac. But what happened after this? - My sister later told me that I had prepared several lines of white powder (2-methyl-AP-237), which were found at a CD cover. This means, I prepared even more to consume than it took to kill me. The only reason I survived is my mother. She usually never comes to my room, but this day she did. She was completely overwhelmed. She managed to bring me to the stable side position and to inform a neighbor who gave me a cardiac massage until the ambulance arrived. The paramedics continued until the emergency doctor arrived. He wanted to know what I took, but my neither my mother nor my sister knew the answer. The 2-methyl-AP-237 looks nearly identical to cocaine, but thankfully the emergency doctor decided to inject naloxone and adrenaline into my carotid artery. My heart started beating by its own again. I didn't notice any of this because I was still unconscious until I woke up in the hospital. I did not realize the incident the first days after. I did not want to acknowledge that I killed myself. I asked myself how it could happen, I thought I consumed in within the scope, but - bullshit. I died and was reanimated. Benzodiazepines and opioids are a deadly combination. This was not new to me, but if you are disinhibited by the clonazolam, you think it wont happen to you. You don't notice anything until it is too late.

"Experience:1.2 g gabapentin, alcohol, and half of 150 mg Effexor XR - Pretty lovely for socializing and giggles","The first gabapentinoid I have ever tried. Next will hopefully be pregabalin. Time when taken was approximately 19:25. 600mg, two halves from a 600mg tab. t+23m - Nothing yet. I take about half of the beads from an Effexor XR 150mg capsule plus another gab half. Effexor XR (venlafaxine) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. t+25m - I pop another 600mg pill and go ahead to the bathroom with my phone to have a shitpiss. t+1h - Check my instagram and I'm having a would-you-rather game with this random guy. I like it. I feel very creative and my mood is rather uplifted. I go and get some chocolate milk, noticing that walking and balance has been impaired. Nearly fell over about twice. Typing seems slightly impeded. I get this nice cold chill up my back which forces me to spasm; this happens often normally and I don't know why. Seems to be a little less intense. This residual cold chill is persistent. t+1h10m - I yawn (again soon after) from a pleasant and mild sedation. A positive and energetic mood manifests further. More chills. t+~5h - Between t+3hr and t+5hr, I was at my brother's house with his and my friend. The friend is ""N"" and the brother is ""L."" They're about 20-28. L looks a bit like a long hair community member/hipster/nordic man who is lanky and tall, and N looks like a slightly buff cool gym guy who is very nice. What we did was play Mortal Kombat XL. While we played, we said TONS of stupid shit, swore a hell of a lot, and other things. About 4hr in, I drank about ~60mL of spiced rum/w wild cherry Pepsi.. Not sure of its ABV or proof. I'm not sure what ""L"" was on, but he was drinking. ""N"" told me he was on some sort of supplement nootropic, but he forgot what it was. Throughout playing, I was talking about how Mortal Kombat is actually Dildo Kombat or Mortal Dildo and was talking about ridiculous shit that made everyone laugh like we just did a big bowl of hash. I did a hardcore brutality with an X-Ray with Sektor. I forgot who the opponent (N's) character was. We were all amazed by this stupid, meaningless thing. It was beautiful. We just kept laughing at stupid shit. Normally, I'd get mad when I lost, but no, I just felt very ok with it because of the laughter and humor with the drug. We went over to the other house (my brother's home is diagonally adjacent to mine), but it was locked, or at least we thought. We stayed outside for a solid 15-30 minutes pissing with shit. Firstly, I asked N what drug experience he had. He replied with acid, I think some downers, and that's it. I believe L has had shrooms before as well as acid and alcohol. He's even tried DPH, but only at 200 mg. (pussy)... Mine includes Ativan (nice), ropinirole (ok), Abilify (shitty), and Focalin. After that, we pissed around with this water gun thing. It's really badly made; I got the thing from Wal-Mart for like 10 bucks, thinking I could fuck with it, but no. The cap to the tank didn't even hold pressure right, and as a result, pumping it only shot the water like one inch. As a result of that, we called it ""Kim Jong-un's Penis"" and the water was his piss. Everyone had some of it on them. When I went behind N and was gonna shoot him, he fucking ran like Usain Bolt into the other house's yard. L and I both laughed at that. Going back to school and shit. After drinking, I got nausea in the form of the ""vomit-up-to-throat and choke it down"" type. Suppressed a little bit with water and sweet tea (that tasted like cotton candy...yummy c':) During that time, I smacked my prescribed medicines into my mouth and finished writing this. Not after finishing writing, we hung out in the kitchen with my grandma. We did some stupid flicking contest. Whoever said ""ow"" first lost. No one lost. Then, L tried to do indian burns on my arm but failed. I did it about three times to N, but he never did it to me or tried to hurt me, he just wrestled his hands away, and of course, we laughed at that as well. t=00:37 - I take one 25mg pill of diphenhydramine for sleep aid. I normally take 50-100 (ADHD people can't sleep well ;^[), but with the other downers, it will certainly help. During typing this, I feel this lovely sense of calmness and reassurance as if I were picked up by a beautiful angel, kissed and hugged, and told I'm amazing or something. Only for two seconds, but it was so sweet. :) I get ready to sleep. Conclusion To conclude, I would definitely try gabapentin again in combination with other lovey drugs or depressants. It's a drug with some nice potential for lovey-bubby and giggly things.

Experience:40mg Zolpidem / 20mg Diazepam - Please Don't Do This,"Background: A girl I really liked said she didn't wanna be with me and I was like oh ok. This was the next day... but I only intended on taking Zolpidem to forget about her. Also sorry about the lack of content, the events are very fuzzy. First Dose: I took 20mg of Zolpidem. All is well. Approx. 45 minutes later: Through the double vision, I started having the delusion that I was indeed sober so I decided to take some Valium. I counted out 10 Valiums (which is 20mg) and downed them. Maybe 20 minutes later: For some reason I decided to check my pulse on our blood pressure cuff at home. It was 136 BPM. Zolpidem usually raises my pulse a bit. The anxiety suppression kept me from being worried about my pulse, because normally I freak out about my heart rate if it's too high and then that starts a cycle of anxiety. Shortly after checking my pulse: My mom asked me if I was okay or not (she didn't know I had taken anything). I don't remember how I responded, but it was apparent to her that I was indeed not okay. She asked me if I wanted to go see a doctor and I said yes. I'm pretty sure I felt fine, but the Zolpidem made me very susceptible to agreeing with basically anything. At the ER: I don't remember the car ride to the ER, or getting a bed. But my memory resumes when I'm on a bed in the ER. The doctor came in and said that the blood samples looked good. I don't remember them drawing any blood. I looked at the top of my arm and there was an IV. Someone asked me if I wanted a blanket and I said yes. I specifically remember seeing a nurse there that I saw during the summer when I went to the ER after my bad DXM trip (I made a report on that DXM trip also). The nurse was encompassed in double vision, along with his surroundings. As the title of this report says, don't do this. For real. Don't.

"Experience:A combination of tramadol, clonazepam, gabapentin, and dimenhydrinate","The orthopedic doc. for a friend, prescribed him tramadol (Tramal, 30x50 mg) for back pain. He is not using opiates, but he has a high tolerance to benzos. I did not take, because I am on fluoxetine.: tramadol + antidepressants = convulsions - serotonin syndrome - death (perhaps.!) 00.00 .: 250 mg tramadol + 4.00 mg clonazepam + 1200 mg gabapentin + 500 mg dimenhydrinate. Good mood. 00.30 .: A warm wave permeates throughout his body. 00.45 .: Euphoria, the only word.!!! Everything seems more 'clean', 'brilliant'. We discuss, and he is extremely optimistic.! 01.20 .: Additional 200 mg (drug limits 400 mg) + 900 mg gabapentin. Tramadol is a magic medicine. It has potential SNRI act and studied as an antidepressant, but has a moderate potential for addiction and abuse. Music (progressive rock) sounds much better - awesome. Everything feels fine. 01.25 .: 10.00 mg clonazepam. I oppose, with such a large dose of clonazepam, with an equally large dose of tramadol is a very bad idea. Both are strong drugs. He wants to get and other 100 mg tramadol. That means over the 400 mg of tramadol. Seems dangerous. Anyway, because I am sure he will do, I think that consumed two anticonvulsants (gabapentin and clonazepam), so i don't worry so much. So he takes another 100 mg. 01.50.: He is not feeling so good, nausea and hypotension. I give him salt for blood pressure and more dimenhydrinate for nausea. Dysarthria, slurred speach, he is like a drunk, disorder and akathisia. I frequently inspect him. I slept on the couch. Next day, he told me it was great experience, although he does no remember many things. He is still 'high'. Sleeping with CEV's. Of course freaked out when he saw how that they are missing 10.00 mg clonazepam. He does not remember anything about that. In my opinion, the best way to get 'high' of tramadol is 100 mg, after 1 hour more 100 mg, after 1 hour more 100 etc. You stop at 400 mg. The problem is that my friend got massively large doses. In the forums I read experiences for tramadol. It's a drug that many people hate or love. People for example who misuse codeine, most of them hate tramadol. My opinion is not to abuse tramadol - the tolerance is rapid. Is 'treacherous' medicine and rehab - as I read experiences - is very difficult.

Note from the future: I did 200 mg the next day, along with 50 mg of promethazine, 10 mg of levomepromazine, and 1 mg of alprazolam. This time it gave me constricted pupils. So the amount I took was too low for the classic opioid effects. It was definitely still pleasurable though. If anything, constricted pupils are an unwanted side effect. I added this because I thought it was worth mentioning that the substance does in fact produce constricted pupils. T+02:26 - Gonna pop a xan (1mg). I know that's a no-no but we're talking low doses, a GABA tolerance, and an experience report from Erowid where the reportee had a great time. T+02:28 - Successfully popped the xan. Going to play some chess now. T+02:31 - Missed an obvious thing in chess. It must be hitting. I do think that opioids are far less cognitively impairing than benzodiazepines. After I've experimented with tapentadol thoroughly I'll try some carisoprodol. From what I've heard it's more like a benzodiazepine, and based on my username you might see why I would like that. T+03:07 - Little brother almost split my face open after slamming the bathroom door open. Pretty pissed about that. Physically, however, I feel very calm and sedated. I am going to take yet another xan so I get the most out of this experience. T+03:09 - Ingested another 1 mg of alprazolam and 25 mg of promethazine. T+03:22 - My AirPods just randomly decided to die on me. I can connect to them but they don't play anything. Kinda ruining my experience. But, oh well, guess everyone else will just have to listen to my music then. T+04:14 - Been playing chess. Was nodding out for real right after I took that second xan. I experienced some concerning respiratory depression. I feel more alert now though T+04:47 - The urge to redose is strong. It was a nice feeling. I'll try 100 mg all at once probably tomorrow. T+04:51 - Took 10 mg of levomepromazine and another xan. I'm going to work a bit on the wiki now. T+05:43 - Took another xan. Might play some games with a friend. T+06:30 - Took my night medication. T+07:25 - Took 1 g of theanine. In conclusion, this drug has a positive effect on me, but the doses I was taking were probably too low.

Experience:25mg Quetiapine - Nice buzz,"Quetiapine has always been an interest of mine, not anything I would desperately want to try, but something I could use for a nice high or for the comedown of other substances. Either way through coincidence I was gifted two of them, from a close friend. They were small and red, had no imprint on them which was strange and weighed 60mgs total. Since I found no information online they must have been either 25 or 50 milligrams (probably 25). No idea haha. They have been sitting around now for months waiting to be taken. Finally I decided to try them at school (what's that? School and drugs don't mix? Hahaha). I took one, not wanting to risk anything. Afraid something might go wrong I took them at noon, where I felt some initial anxiety although not related to the drug. The anxiety was gone about 20 minutes in and I was nicely relaxed, smooth movements and general easiness. After one hour I was probably at peak. There was more pronounced social anxiety when I returned to PE class. I didn't know what to say, after making a joke straight upon entering the room somebody already asked if I had taken something. I was surprised that they knew, when even I had the feeling I could control myself (I paid close attention to this). Although they know how much stuff I consume. Maybe it was the movements, maybe the eyes, no idea. Exercise was difficult, it seems this drug doesn't reduce anxiety if you have some anxiety about the drug having an effect on your heart (which it didn't have). Interestingly there were some slight visual disturbances (although I have HPPD, it was a bit more visible). The most interesting part was when looking at the door, someone seemed to have sprayed something pink, although the spraying had actually come from somewhere else and I in fact saw some pink clouds in front of that person. They walked away, the clouds reappeared then disapeared again. Couldn't bring them back. Over the rest of the day I was extremely tired, almost falling asleep whilst having these weird deliriant-type visuals, which I could clearly see when I looked directly at them. There were also closed eye visuals. When I got home I passed out, slept 12 hours straight and went to work, refreshed, no hangover. I've also had some crazy vivid dreams. Overall, it's more interesting as I've imagined it to be, by this dose it delivers a nice buzz although it is very hard to stay awake.

Experience:Propofol IV during endoscopy,"Woke from anesthesia and felt great. Was suffering from uncontrollable vomiting for over a week. Zofran, dilaudid, and lorazepam slowed the frequency but only after I was put under anesthesia for a gastric endoscopy did the nausea stop. Was given propofol and fentanyl during procedure and afterwards I felt 100% better. No opiate use in prior 6 months so I was not experiencing opiate withdrawal. It was the Propofol. I was instantly better, feeling refreshed and alert. No nausea or vomiting even after the fentanyl wore off. Have not had an episode of cyclical vomiting syndrome in 4 years. Would like to try propofol again to see if it has such a pronounced effect when not experiencing nausea. Submitted by - Ryno78",['nausea suppression'],171
Experience: 100 mg Promethazine (Oral) - Netflix & Depression,"T+00:00 - Time of ingestion: 13:20. Laying down in bed. So done with everything. Couldn't endure my online classes. Promethazine is supposed to have anxiolytic effects so hopefully I'll feel better in a few minutes. Gonna start rewatching the Queen's Gambit now. Will probably fall asleep because it is very sedating for me. T+00:03 - Starting to feel warm inside. It's probably a placebo, I don't think it kicks in this fast. T+00:05 - I was nauseous due to anxiety so hopefully this will suppress it. T+00:20 - I'm tired. T+00:35 - Still nauseous. My feet feel cold. The rest of my body feels warm. T+01:00 - I ate some carrots and drank a Vitamin Well. Don't feel as tired anymore. T+01:40 - Eating some nuts. I think my anxiety has been reduced and I'm not very tired which I find surprising since I was knocked out before by 50 mg. T+02:20 - Slightly tired. Feel the warmness in my body. T+04:10 - Very tired. Gonna try to take a nap. T+05:10 - Got out of bed. Less tired now. T+08:10 - I think the experience is over now. I believe it ended after about 6 hours.

Experience:50mg Pregabalin - Surprisingly strong,"Background: I just started Lyrica for Restless Legs Syndrome and have been trying 50 mg for the past few days to ensure there are no serious side effects. Experience: At around 2200 Eastern Standard Time I consumed 50 mg of Lyrica and about ten minutes later I decided to take a bubble bath. As I waited for the bathtub to fill with water, I listened to some calming music. Maybe ten minutes or so after I got in the bath (at around 2234) I started feeling some effects from the Lyrica. It was hard to characterize, but I felt extremely calm and peaceful, much like a bar of alprazolam without the disinhibition and ""out of it"" feeling. It was actually rather pleasant. It had no effect on the restless legs, and I was told by my doctor it would take about a week or so to have any effect on it. I actually felt very sociable and had the strong desire to talk with people. I felt a tad sleepy but it was not overwhelming. All of this felt rather natural, unlike benzodiazepines which have a more forced sedation and have more kick. There was a welcoming albeit very mild euphoria. The calming effect got more and more powerful. Music sounded amazing and I was very into the music I was listening to. I went to bed at around 0056 and fell asleep very quickly and woke up very refreshed. Conclusion: 50 mg of pregabalin (currently only sold under the brand name Lyrica by Pfizer) was much stronger and nicer than I expected. I can definitely see why some psychiatrists prescribe it for anxiety, it was extremely calming without the general head-space of benzodiazepines or barbiturates. I will likely have to up my dose and I'll update this report as I do that.

Experience:225mg Pregabalin +Cannabis -Bliss and Serenity; a hedonistic evening,"T+0=6:30; ingestion of 75mg pregabalin capsules x3 T+35min; slight lightness of body and limbs noticable. Mood lifts and become playful, possibly placebo. T+1hr30min; strange tactile sensations can be felt; a nice warm tingling. Colours seem intensified, not brighter but as if passed through a filter. We're playing supersmash bros and giggling a lot. Slight ataxia noticed. T+2hr; face becomes flush, pupils become somewhat slow to react; strange CEVs (like spinning lights, all out of phase). Initially I thought they were dilated but adjusted very slowly. Heart rate is slowed somewhat and I start to draw and sketch -seems like a boost in creativity. Ataxia is more pronounced. Everyone is giggling at everything. My friend becomes amazing at supersmash bros, prega has unlocked his gaming power. T+2hr20min; Strong anxiolysis. sharing some cannabis in joints adds a nice layer to the experience. Vision is bright and glossy; not any hallucination but some sort of other visual alteration. Some distortion in peripheral vision; objects/shapes. Slurring of speech noticed. T+2hr35min; Everyone becomes ravenously hungry. We stop playing and devour all food in the kitchen; crisps, biscuits, fruit, yoghurts, bread. End up making a batch of around 40 chocolate and nut cookies. Then make curry, eat it and invite all our mates over. T+4hr40min; Strong ataxia, feeling 'wavy' and feelings of floating are noticed. mates start to arrive and all notice we're acting weird and obviously intoxicated. every now and again i burst into almost uncontrollable laughter. And those on prega discuss how we're all slightly motivated. Movement feels greatttt (similar to GHB). Very spacey headspace; I keep zoning out, dreaming of complex structures with moving components. Because of this i keep getting lost in my thoughts and the film becomes non-sensical but amazing to watch nevertheless, soud distortions notice (voices sound v. strange). T+5hr; We all watch a film after smoking more bud. Watching a classic; blade runner. I am completely immersed in the film, so thrilled. Its so vibrant and looks amazing; also intensly emotionally immersed also. Everything is so serene, I have no worries in the world. T+6hr; Very sedated...struggling to keep eyes open, mild nystagmus is present. Strong euphoria, similar to the 'bliss' felt on benzos and opioids. We discuss the difference between euphoria and bliss and conclude that euphoria is a stimulating ecstasy, where as bliss is a sedative ecstasy. My mind is so quiet and peaceful. Not long after my last entry I ended up falling asleep on the sofa, then woke up and walked home as it was early morning. I semi-blacked out and my memory is a little hazy (cant remember waking up and walking home). However, the vivid and strange dreams i can remember; like a film reel before my eyes. Strange frantic characters and bright colours. After effects/next morning: Slight muscle ache the next day and a little groggy when i woke up; nothing a cup of coffee didn't fix. Saw my friends and laughed at hour hungry we all suddenly became. we spent around 2hours cooking solidly. N.B. -As someone with visual snow (VS) many drugs alter the flow and pattern of its appearance. This calmed the pattern to a pseudo-random multi-coloured sparkle (rather than geometry) that hung around certain objects. Compared with other depressants, this is an atypical response (except the reduction in kinetic energy/speed) as the VS was enhanced and intensified. Summary: Very enjoyable, euphoric/bliss, very trippy feel to it and intense strange headspace. Uncommon effects on hunger and social interaction. Great time had by all, shame about the hazy memory.

Experience: 80 mg Oxycodone (Oral/Insufflated) - My Highest Dose,"T+00:00 - I swallowed three 20 mg oxycodone capsules at 11:40 (60 mg in total) that I had made the day before. I made them from 10 mg extended release tablets by Lannacher. I crushed them with my mortar and used capsules from some supplements. I simply binned the supplements and put the crushed pills inside the capsules and resealed them. T+00:05 - I hopped in the shower. Obviously no effects yet due to oral route of administration. T+00:45 - First effects. That classic warm and euphoric feeling. Put on my Spotify playlist and played it through my AirPods Pro. T+01:40 - I crushed up two 10 mg pills (20 mg in total) and insufflated it over the course of 5 minutes. The total dose is now 80 mg. T+03:10 - I tried really hard to urinate but it was impossible. I even turned on the tap to hear and see running water to try to make it easier but it didn't work. T+03:20 - I took my blood pressure and it was 126/76, pulse 74 BPM. Usually it hurts a little but I didn't feel anything. T+03:25 - Ate lunch without any problems. Have not experienced appetite suppression. If anything I've experienced appetite enhancement. I'm underweight and usually don't have a very strong appetite but I've been snacking on things throughout the experience. T+03:30 - Successfully urinated and went out for a walk. Was still itching a lot. T+04:05 - Returned home, made some tea and ate a banana. The walk was euphoric. Unsuccessfully urinated. My face, head, and whole upper body is itching a lot and my skin is a little red. T+04:20 - Successfully urinated. T+04:30 - Spilled water on my desk. Back pain returned while cleaning it up. I think the analgesic effects are subsiding. My pupils are still very constricted though. T+05:00 - Feeling tired and sedated. Rumbling in ears. Just watching YouTube videos and browsing Reddit. T+05:30 - I can barely keep my eyes open. I might fall asleep. I'm listening to some rain sounds. T+05:40 - I just urinated without any difficulties which signals to me that the experience is over. My pupils are still very constricted though. T+06:00 - I know it's bad to combine opiates with benzodiazepines but I don't feel very good so I think I'm gonna land on 1 mg of alprazolam. T+06:05 - I must have been sweating more than usual because I can tell that I smell like sweat. That's weird. Guess it's the increased perspiration side effect. T+06:20 - Feeling slightly nauseous. To be honest I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner since I threw up the first time I insufflated 40 mg of oxycodone. Note from the future: I also threw up my second time insufflating 40 mg after a one week tolerance break. Yet another note from the future: I threw up twice and felt like pure shit after insufflating roughly 25 mg. I think my body simply can't handle oxycodone anymore. I'm quitting this shit forever. Yet another note from the future: I was clean from opioids for 33 days but relapsed on tapentadol. My brain was constantly craving that opioid high and I couldn't keep going on without it so here I am. Yet another note from the future: After using kratom daily for a month and a half, during which I had one vomiting incident, my body can now handle oxycodone easily without any nausea. The downside is that it's not nearly as euphoric anymore, but it at least makes me somewhat tranquil and retains its analgesic effects. T+07:10 - No nausea anymore. Still experiencing some itchiness.

"Experience:6-10g Red Maeng Da - Minor Dissociation and a Peculiar ""Nod""","I've been in love with kratom since I first started using it this year. That beautiful warmth and comfort—mental and physical—that the opiates grant, all without the risks and dependence. As perfectly comfortable for spending hours doing nothing as it is for going out and being social, or doing some simple work. Whatever you choose to do, it seems to improve, all while in a headspace that doesn't feel high or otherwise unlike one's usual self. I use it infrequently to maintain a lack of tolerance: perhaps twice a week at most. With higher dosages I notice some interesting effects which seem to be particular to my experience, to some extent. One time when I did a high dose, in darkness, staring at a patterned surface would produce swirling organization of the pattern which would reset on double-take: strictly two-dimensional. Another time produced mild visual drifting after staring at an object. I'm pretty sure this might have something to do with the mild visual disconnection kratom induces, and it perhaps might be related to the dissociative mindset I seem to have since experimenting with dissociatives (cannabis, for example, has had a totally different, more psychedelic character to it since this experimentation). I get the opiate ""nod"" from a solid dose of kratom almost every time- that beautiful half-sleep where your ideations realize as semi-lucid dreams, and wakefulness and sleep don't seem so separate. Usually I use this to explore past memories vividly, or fantasize, always in that hypnagogic visualization space and never perceived as actual vision, but once, the ""nod"" was distinctly different. It seemed totally out of my control; random objects flying in a rapid circle in a void, whenever I closed my eyes. It wasn't uncomfortable, but bizarre. I've assumed it's just a hypnagogic peculiarity. Kratom is a really great natural substance, and I think there might be more to it than the ""opiate"" it's frequently understood to be.

Experience: 20 mg Ketobemidone (Oral) - An Interesting but Underwhelming Compound,"Front side of a 5 mg Ketogan® pill Back side of a 5 mg Ketogan® pill A blister pack of 10 5 mg Ketogan® pills T+00:00 - Ingested 5 mg of ketobemidone at precisely 11:00. Tasted it before swallowing it. It did not taste too bad, very mild. I have the whole day off and can relax at home. T+00:15 - No noticeable effects so far. I'm just fooling around on the computer. Actually, I might be getting slight itchiness. T+00:20 - Feeling some tingling. T+00:40 - No significant effects yet so I will dose another 5 mg. T+00:45 - Slight respiratory depression and slight itching. T+00:47 - Experiencing some minor euphoria and relaxation. So far no noteworthy pupil constriction, but I am expecting that to happen sooner or later. It is also worth mentioning that I have recently been experiencing some moderate back pain, so I will be noting the analgesic effects of this compound as well. T+00:50 - I have now urinated without any difficulties. T+01:00 - No real difference in effects at this point. T+01:10 - I have now redosed another 5 mg. I was led to believe that ketobemidone is one of the best (most euphoric) opioids out there, so currently I am unfortunately underwhelmed. I should note, however, that I have been using oxycodone and tapentadol recently. Tapentadol has completely lost its recreational value for me, and it's almost to the point where oxycodone isn't euphoric anymore either. One of my most euphoric drug experiences was when I took 40 mg of OxyNorm. It was pure and utter bliss. I could barely walk, that's how hard it hit me. When I use oxycodone nowadays, I sadly only get some minor opioid warmth and pain relief, so this could be the reason for these results. T+01:20 - My back doesn't hurt anymore but I still have some tension in my neck. T+01:30 - Currently listening to some music. Some opioid warmth has arrived now. I am tempted to redose again, which I shall shortly. Since the compound is rare and expensive, the next time I use it I will ingest the whole dose simultaneously as to hopefully maximize the euphoric effects. I may also pick a different route of administration with a higher bioavailablity. T+01:50 - I urinated without any difficulties. And there is still no pupil constriction. T+02:00 - Moderate itching, on my legs and face. T+02:10 - I'm mostly just itching, but I guess I feel content. I would not call this eupohoria though. As far as I can tell I am still coherent and not out of it. Also, now the pupil constriction came. They're not quite pinpoint pupils but they're getting there. T+02:20 - I'm redosing another 5 mg now. I can feel some mild physical euphoria. Probably a little more than what I'm getting from oxycodone. T+02:35 - I am now feeling quite mellow and sedated. T+02:50 - I'm just chilling for now. I regret to say that I am disappointed. I will save 25 to 30 mg for another time when I either have a lower opioid tolerance or will be potentiating it with alprazolam or some other depressant. T+02:55 - I'm feeling relaxed and calm, a bit tired and sedated too. So while this hasn't been a negative expericne, it wasn't what I expected. I still do not have pinpoint pupils. T+03:05 - I think I am experiencing some weak cognitive disconnection. My head feels funny. T+03:30 - I am now working on formatting this experience report. Still itching a little. When I looked in the bathroom mirror, my pupils could be considered pinpoint pupils, but this was in a bright environment. My room is less luminous so they're a slightly more dilated in here. And I felt some kind of resistance when urinating now, but it wasn't as severe as what I usually get from oxycodone. T+04:00 - Yeah, I'm mostly just relaxed. I'm blasting some $uicideboy$ on my AirPods. T+04:54 - I'd say the experience is over now. Experience reports on Erowid indicate that ketobemidone can be potentiated by insufflating oxycodone or vaporizing cannabinoids. T+05:10 - My pupils remain constricted. I will now ingest 0.5 mg alprazolam sublingually. T+06:20 - Pupil constriction has ended.

Experience: 2100 mg Gabapentin (Oral) - Nodding Off,"I took 300 mg every 30 minutes until I reached 2100 mg. Instead of taking another 300 mg I took 25 mg of quetiapine and 30 mg of mirtazapine (my daily sleep medication). I believe I was awake for another 2 hours, then I passed out at my desk and woke up 1.5 hours later being extremely intoxicated, having reduced visual acuity, double vision, and severely impaired motor control. It was very difficult to walk. It was pretty similar to being very drunk. I don't think I was slurring or having difficulties speaking but at that dose it actually became a little amnesic so I don't fully remember the details of what happened. Pretty interesting drug I guess. I took 1.5 mg of alprazolam 50 minutes before my first dose. I know you're not supposed to mix benzos with other GABAergic drugs, but I figured it would clear my system before any of the gabapentin would kick in. As far as I know, it did. I wouldn't combine it with quetiapine again though at that high of a dose. It just knocked me out and removed the rush.

Experience:400mg and 300mg of fluorophenibut,"My friend and I acquired some fluorophenibut (4-Amino-3-(4-fluorophenyl)butanoic acid) and decided to test it out ourselves as it seemed very promising. We could barely find any information about this substance online (besides some forum and Reddit posts). After doing a bit of research, we were able to work out the recommended dosage. Some users reported that 200mg fluoro-phenibut was equal to about 2 grams of phenibut. At 3:30PM, I dosed out 400mg for myself and 300mg for my friend, hoping that my dosage would be equal in potency to about 4 grams of phenibut (which was my go-to recreational dose). We were very pleased to find that we could feel the effects of the substance within only 20 minutes which is a huge upgrade to regular phenibut (since it can take more than five hours to kick in). We both felt a strong euphoric body high and physical euphoria that felt as though it originated in our stomach and extended outwards. After an hour had gone by, I experienced anxiety suppression and felt as though socializing had become easier. My friend also became more talkative and reported mild muscle relaxation. They stated that the fluoro-phenibut seemed more sedating than phenibut. At three hours in, I felt like I was peaking on the fluoro-phenibut. The dosage felt like it was on the lower end of the strong. My friend and I decided to redose 150mg at this point (6:30PM). The physical euphoria was getting very intense and I felt strong cognitive euphoria about nothing in particular other than I was high and felt really amazing. I started to think my redose might be too much, but decided to wait and see. I had a feeling similar to that which I experience on stimulants where I felt like ""FUCK YEAH"" at the world for no reason. The overall high felt very similar that which is experienced on phenibut, GHB, and GBL. We both felt disinhibition, but it was not as intense as benzodiazepines or alcohol. I also began to have mild nausea and dizziness, but I figured that must be from taking so high of a dose as well as a redose. The physical euphoria was hard to ignore and was still overwhelming. The fluoro-phenibut lasted ages and I still felt its effects when I went to bed at 2AM, eight hours after I took my redose. Next time, I will likely dose 550mg or 600mg since anymore might make me too nauseous. Later that day, my wife dosed 500mg of fluoro-phenibut and thought it was an enjoyable experience, but stated that she would like to try 700mg next time. Keep in mind that both her and I are hardcore gabagenic users so our dosages might be too intense for most average people. I slept for 12 hours and when I woke up, I still felt very tired and comedowny from the fluoro-phenibut. I felt sluggish and slow all day, although the 3-MeO-PCE that I took two nights ago may be contributing to this as well. My friend, who had taken the 300mg dose and a 150mg redose, also remarked that they felt comedowny, tired, and slow. Overall, fluoro-phenibut is a huge improvement to phenibut and will definitely be something we will explore more in the future. It seems like a very good GHB or GBL replacement and is incredibly recreational.

Experience:2mg Etizolam - Here be dragons,"0 min - I start with 2mg of Etizolam, as it had been a couple days without a cigarette. 30 min - I start to feel really mellow, and forget completely about my desire for a smoke. 1 hour - I try to play a game online with a friend, and everything starts off alright. After maybe half an hour, she's telling me that I'm just running around in circles, but I thought I was doing great. 2 hours - She's now telling me that she can't understand what I'm saying. I'm enunciating, and using real words, but they're out of order and irrelevant to what the topic of conversation is. 2 hours+ - I black out at this point, but I remember fragments. The first thing I remember is being handcuffed and bonking my head on the door of the squad car. Now I get why they push your head down. The next thing I recall is waking up in the County psych ward at 2 in the morning. I remember dosing at about 6pm on Tuesday, so I figure this makes sense, but I'm terrified of this place. It's 20 cots in a room, and half the people are screaming. I have to wait 4 hours before anyone will tell me why I'm here, and I don't have my wallet or even any shoes. The doctor shows me the police report, but the first thing I notice is that the date and time on it reads ""5pm, Wednesday, August 16th, 2017."" Confused, I ask the doctor what day it is. She tells me it's Thursday, and that I was apparently acting crazy all yesterday. I read further in the report, and it says I chased my roommate around the house with a knife, which is so far out of character for me that I think it's a joke. Well, it wasn't a joke, and they finally let me out at 11pm Thursday, thanks to my roommates not pressing charges. When I get home, I look in the Etizolam container, and find that out of the 50mg I started with, only 22 were left. My best guess of what happened was that I blacked out and kept redosing the whole time, and I had a strange and violent reaction to it. I understand that this type of experience is probably very rare, and most likely wouldn't happen to the average person. All I can suggest is that anyone who wants to try Etizolam be very careful, and maybe have someone monitor your consumption. I learned the hard way that this kind of thing just isn't for me.

Experience:3mg Etizolam - A Comedown Drug,"This is a general explanation of my history of using etizolam as a comedown aide and sleep aide. I volumetrically dose 3mg of etizolam when I begin to feel overwhelmed by the stimulant after effects of other substances. Within 30 minutes of orally dosing, I can feel the main physical effects I will describe below. There is a floaty sense of euphoria and the sedative haze that I love dearly. If I want to come down immediately, I will sometimes smoke my etizolam. This creates an instant effect and is much more euphoric and compulsive than orally dosing etizolam. Regardless of the ROA, etizolam in the 1-3mg range will have me sedated and asleep within two hours. I think this is a valuable tool for cutting stimulant experiences short and ensuring a good night's sleep. Overall, etizolam is a calming and euphoric drug that produces little amnesia when used at the correct dosages. I prefer it to aid with a difficult comedown or ensure that I am in bed on time.

Experience:20mg Etizolam - Smoking Etizolam,"I was high as balls, so the only notes taken during the experience noted the dosage. ~11pm - I vaporized 5mg of etizolam on foil. This kicks in surprisingly fast. There was no rush, just a sense of calm. This is a light dose for me. 11:10pm - I vaporized 8 more mg. This is now 13mg total. This dose has brought me to a moderate intoxication level, especially in terms of Motor control loss 11:30pm - I vaporized another 7mg. This brings the total to 20mg. This gave me a strong level of a benzo high. It is a nice, detached, floaty, and mild feeling. Cognitive euphoria. I am sufficiently sedated and off to bed. Overall, this was an interesting experience. It is much more euphoric than the oral ROA of etizolam. The shorter duration may make this drug more compulsive when smoked, than when taken orally.

"Experience:Diazepam (20/10mg, Oral) - Comfortably Drunk","First Dose: 20mg of pharmaceutical grade diazepam, taken orally. T - 1 Hour Had a phone call with my dad that started around 6:30. Enjoyably conversation. First feelings of intoxication begin to take hold; my brain feels fuzzy, like a cleaner drunkenness. I wrap up the call as I'm beginning to struggle with holding a conversation as the fuzziness takes hold. Twinges of anxiety/adrenaline as I feel the high hitting me. T - 1 Hour, 15 Minutes Starting to feel pretty fucked up, but it's still a little subtle for my liking; possibly the influences of the compulsive redosing element? I decide to take another 10mg of diazepam orally, bringing the total dose up to 30mg. I'm feeling pretty comfy and chill. Despite feeling psychologically cogent, the fuzzy dizziness is pretty intense. Listening to Youtube in the background as I write this. I'm normally a pretty excellent typist, but find I'm struggling a little bit to maintain my usual standards of accuracy. Kind of feeling hungry; the feeling is similar to being up at 3AM after drinking, and I'm REALLY craving a kebab. T - 1 Hour, 30 Minutes I find when I use alprazolam (Xanax) I feel a little bit listless and bored. With this though, I'm feeling much less anxious and euphoric. Feeling just, groovy about everything. Spent some time fighting the impared motor functions to make little jenga towers out of pills. I tested out the muscle relaxant effect by trying to raise a hand for a while; didn't take long for it to drift back down to my desk. Toying with cooking something, but I use a really sharp knife and despite feeling more sober than I am, I am at least cogent enough to realise that cooking would be a bad idea. Fuck I am SO hungry. Aughghghg. FOOD. WHERE FOOD. T - 2 Hour, 30 Minutes I went and cooked some rice and szechuan sauce out of spare shit I had in the house. Found cooking very mellow and fun. The meal itself tasted incredible; while I'm a good cook, I definitely think that the diazepam did something with like, appetite potentiation or something. Yummo. Also totally forgot I had a cup of tea waiting in my room so that was a nice surprise. Toying with taking another 10mg but I'm not sure whether that would lead to unconsciousness or just a really mellow night. I am definitely feeling pretty sleepy and just deeply mellowed out.

"Experience:2ml 1,4-Butanediol - Not as good as alcohol","T+0 - Dosed about 1.6mls, setting: alone at home, third time trying it after two unsuccessful attemts at 1.5ml and 2.5ml (over time). T+0:30 - I begin to get somewhat dizzy, sort of like the alcohol-feeling, but not as euphoric. It‘s more clearheaded. T+0:40 - I dose another 0.6ml, as I „don‘t feel that much“; totaling 2.2ml. T+0:50 - While watching videos on youtube I notice people magically look more beautiful than I would see them normally, no visual distortions or anything. I feel what people are doing generates more emotions for me than I would normally experience. T+1:00 - I get really dizzy and extremely nauseated; I run to the toilet and sit in front of it incase I throw up. I could spit a whole lot for some reason it was like my mouth was a waterfall. T+2:00 - I don‘t remember anything the hour or so after that so I guess I blacked out. I didn‘t puke but I sat in an awkward position the entire time my left arm was streched now it hurts. My left leg also fell asleep pretty badly, it was extremely painful to get up. T+2:10 - I feel way better. Now it‘s sorta enjoyable again. I go to bed, don‘t remember though but I fell asleep pretty easy. No real hangover next morning, no difficulty getting up at 7 am. Overall not as good as alcohol by far, it‘s more nauseating than it is disorienting and euphoric.

Experience:Alprazolam (24 mg) - Into the Void,"Preface Prior to this I had very little experience when it came to the realm of benzodiazepines. Previous experiences with benzos included clonazepam (multiple experiences ranging anywhere from 1-3 mg) and of course, alprazolam.(in previous experiences, I had never dosed >4 mg). When this experience happened I hadn't dabbled with benzos in a few months, so my tolerance was at base line. I deeply regret this experience and it is truly the only bad experience I have had with any substance in my life. I strongly urge anyone taking Xanax to refrain from redosing; you will not receive any more euphoria. You can only get so high before you fall into the void and end up doing something extremely stupid. Experience I came home after a nice day at school, bored out of my mind with nothing to do and no plans, so naturally I decide it might be time to have a little fun. I looked around and discovered that most of my stash was drained, so I decided to hit up the normal connections, everyone seemed to be dry but one of the connects happened to have 12 bars of Xanax he was trying to sell since he no longer needed them. These bars were 2 mg each labeled ""gg249"", he was letting them go for extremely cheap, so I decided to purchase all of them. I came home later that night and decided to pop 2 bars and within about 15 minutes I started to feel extremely relaxed and frankly fucked up, in this state of mind I decided it would be a good idea to redose for a total of 6 mg in my system, however as soon as I took the 3rd bar I decided to hide the rest of the bars in my wallet, so I wouldn't redose. Next thing I remember is me attempting to get into bed to go to sleep and that is about all I remember. Until it happens, all I remember are flashes of memories, me at school running into lockers, screaming at nurses, my blood being drawn (Most vivid out of all of them), police being called to my home, trying to start fights, driving dangerously, me walking around a mental hospital, me screaming in a shower in a hospital, etc. I then finally completely come to it and realize that I fucked up. I was in a psychiatric hospital, it turns out it had been about 4 or 5 days since I originally dosed my first bar, I was in complete awe, it was like I took a time travel machine and showed up here in this hospital. To make things short I wound up staying there for a few weeks, the entire time I was there I thought I only took 6 mg, but when I finally came home it turns out I actually took 24 mg in total. I know this because the bag I hid in my wallet was empty, friends were telling me I was going crazy for about 2 days constantly redosing and taking bar after bar (Remember none of this I don't think). I thought I had taken 3 bars and went to bed, but it turns out I went insane and was on a Xanax binge. After Thoughts This experience completely changed my mindset when it came to drugs, I respect substances a hell of a lot more than I used to now, if I had to give a piece of advice I would say stick to your doses.

"Experience:Nicotine (tobacco, very small amount) - Kind of underwhelming","t+000 (Approx 12:55p) - First hit from a foil-pipe connected to pen setup. It has a filter in it.

I don't really get how people can get that addicted to this. I don't really want to eat; before I was kind of hungry. I feel good, I guess. The filter is a menthol. It tastes kind of like earthy, yet spicy mint. Very obvious I've been smoking if you smelled my breath; gonna mouthwash it out. About 3-4 hits so far. All of the tobacco has been exhausted.

Experience:1g Methiopropamine - Chasing the Chalky Dragon,"I obtained 1g of MPA, and I'm very excited about it. I hadn't had a any stimulants other than caffeine and nicotine for 6 months, so I feel that I'm in for a treat. Day 1 - I take ~40mg orally, and I wait patiently for the effects. About 20 min later my body starts to tingle and vibrate and I am utterly euphoric, both physically and cognitively. I feel as if I can accomplish anything, and over the next half hour the feeling ramps up, and I'm writhing on the floor in pleasure. It abruptly stops, and I figure that since I have so much, I can do it again later in the day. This time I insufflate ~50mg, and I'm met with the same effects, at 150% the intensity. I'm convinced that this is my new favorite thing, and I can just keep at it, since there's so much. I periodically take similar doses all night, not realizing how dangerous it is. Day 2 - I didn't sleep all night, and now it doesn't feel nearly as nice as the previous day. But I know that if I go to sleep now, I'll mess up my sleep regimen. So I continue to take it all day, so I can stay awake until a reasonable time, and then sleep. I have class at noon the next day, so I figure I'll get myself together by then. I still do not notice how fast I'm going through my MPA. I am also ignorant of the time, and when I finally look a clock, it's 2 AM. I convince myself that I can't sleep now, or I'll wake up too late for class. Once again, I stay up all night. Day 3 - At this point, I feel like a degenerate, and I would say that I am fully addicted already to this poison. I have to make it to class, but it's 3 hours long, 4.5 including travel. So I make several capsules, and this is when I realize that I'm now out of MPA. I tell myself that I'll figure out what to do about getting more later. While I'm driving, I take 90mg in capsules, and I feel like death. I'm itchy, sweaty, and my skin is breaking out. I get to school, and I can feel everyone's eyes on me. I'm mortified and just want to go home. While in class, I take capsules while the teacher isn't looking. I'm barely alive at this pint. I take my last 50mg on the drive home, and my tolerance is so high that it doesn't even matter. I pass out as soon as I get home. The day is effectively over. Epilogue - I wake up, and look in the mirror. I look like utter shit; my skin is red and bumpy, my eyes are bone dry, the bags under my eyes honestly look like black eyes. I apparently had some teeth grinding/mastication issues, and had been chewing on the insides of my lips, leaving my whole mouth bruised and swollen. I can barely speak. I also hadn't eaten, and I'm doubled over in pain from hunger. I drink water, and my stomach growls and aches like never before in my life. It takes me a good week to get back to baseline. This substance seems to be highly addictive, and it's rewards are very short-lived. Please be careful if you try it. I definitely do not recommend this substance. I would trust a snake before myself on MPA.

Experience:0.75g MDMA - Possibly some MDA through metabolisation?,"Preamble: Between my friend and I we usually take somewhere approximately 1/1.5g. This never fails to get me to a visual psychedelic headspace, however I'm becoming increasingly convinced that it's either just my weight (I'm about 60 kg / 132 lbs) - or I metabolize the original chemical to MDA somewhere along the line. It could also be a mixed visual effect due to MDMA and THC(weed). It should be noted that my companion hardly ever notes any visual effect except CEVs and enhanced patten recognition. Anyway; on with the trip report: Time: 00:45 0.75g was divided into four approximately 187.5 mg caps each, we then dropped our first caps, one each, and went for a walk. We smoked a joint and discussed what to do later with our time, as time wore on approximately an hour passes and we were both just on the brink of ‘coming up.' At this point, it is usually a good idea to take the next cap. So we both do. Time: 01:45 Roughly half an hour passes as we smoke another joint. Very little visual effect to note yet, just the amphetamine rush and the usual fast-paced conversation going nowhere. Both of us are waiting for the experience to calm and mature a little yet. Hence the weed. Time: 02:15 The experience has now changed from a rushed frenzy of aimlessly chatting about anything to a deeper feeling of understanding and contentment. This stage is normally the precursor to the psychedelic MDMA experience. We walked around the town for another two hours, discussing the intricacies of the world in all its pointless detail, we have arrived at a favorite bench by this point, and it’s definitely time for another joint, as we smoke this joint, I can feel that I've finally arrived at the point I'd set out to find, my pattern recognition is going flat out on any surface I look at, the more textured and intricate, the more potential for OEVs and the disconnected ability to somewhat steer this process. (See below.) I’m looking upon a mossy tree now. Faces jump out everywhere, then logos, signs, badges and other such imagery, all of it tellingly slightly above the object (tree) itself. This seems to be repeatable and replaceable, each and every time I do this, I gain a seemingly better understanding of how this process works, at least subjectively; the pattern recognition based OEVs seem to work like this for me: 1) You look at a symmetrically textured or intricate surface such as a tree, brick wall, or asphalt to name but a few examples. 2) Now your patten recognition seems to be greatly enhanced to the point where you can actually see the almost shapes clearer than you could normally see an actual shape. They seem outlined with almost opaque lines, which are perfectly lined up to the original image, so as to highlight the image you saw/sensed within the chaos. 3) The really interesting or at least bizarre part now, is that the image seems to be superimposed on the object, but not actually ‘in’ the surface of the object, but floating a short distance from it, hanging in the air. This is strange, as when you look dead on the object from the angle you first started looking at it from, the fact that the superimpositions are floating does not affect the subjective effect, seemingly there isn’t any ‘depth’ to the superimposition. The oddness really seems to come into play when you move relative to the object while keeping it in your visual field, then you can see the superimposition hovering in front of the object. A few remarks about the above -Looking away from the object (completely) at any point, then looking back resets the phenomenon temporarily, however, when you look back the whole process begins to take place again. -It would appear that while this process can happen if you let your mind run free with the visual stimulus, however, the more you expect it and attempt to steer it, the faster you can get at ‘enabling’ the superimposed layer on familiar objects, even between trips. I have a couple theories about what this phenomenon could be about, however, this whole thing seems very tenuous as I am the only one I know of so far with this experience, therefore I can’t even be sure it’s not just a totally subjective effect, I do have my suspicions. Time: 03:45 We’ve been sitting at this bench for a few hours now, about half way though being here, we drop our third caps, even though it feels more like 15 minutes we’ve been here for, it’s time to leave. We set off on the long walk back home, smoking cigarettes and discussing the odd phenomenon above, among other visual psychedelic effects we’re both experiencing. Time: 04:25 We’re almost home, and the symmetrical texture repetition on the tarmac is really intriguing me, the psychedelic experience only started maximum two hours ago, so this is reaching its visual peak. We are home. We go and sit down for a while on a sofa gazing at the many textured and detailed pattens around this house, smoking a few joints now and again really seems to keep the experience from tailing off or coming in waves. Time: 05:00 It’s 5AM. We’re both starting to feel the edges of the comedown on its way. Time for the last caps. We drop these and smoke some more weed. This is when things get decidedly more visual again. I look at a tree, far off in the garden, with the early morning light not even here yet, it’s lit by a street lamp in a faint yellow glow. As the branches sway with the breeze I begin to notice pattens in the branches, the branches begin to mark out a larger area than they actually cover, forming impossibly detailed shapes, and at one point the tree is more like a movie, panning across mountains and slopes, this movie phenomenon seems to be caused by the moving of the tree synchronizing with the patten detection to make a coherent moving image from shape to shape almost frame by frame in technical parlance. Time: 05:50 This last cap is really affecting me now, as I look for objects around this room the euphoria and visual effects are somewhat overwhelming, and I end up rolling another joint, and declaring it a night, as we smoke the last of our weed the trip seems to be 3/4 over, time for bed. Time: 06:30 I finally get off the computer having been looking for more textures etc online, and note that this room is covered in green overlaid pinstripes. I sleep, finally. Notes This trip was one of the shortest with this compound, however, we’d usually start earlier in the evening. The visuals seemed consistent with most of my other experiences with this compound, and familiar to most phenethylamine visuals.

Experience:250mg MDA / 250mg MDMA - unnecessarily large dosage,"I should start this trip report with a disclaimer about my dose and tolerance. Taking as much MDA as I did would not be a good idea for someone who has not tried it before. My tolerance is I would suggest starting out at or below 100mg. I have friends that found 100mg to be too much, but they LOVED doses in the 50-60mg range. I ate a large meal at least an hour before dosing. This may have contributed to the late onset of the effects. It was more than an hour after eating my initial 150mg of MDA that I decided that I must have gotten some really weak stuff. My girlfriend convinced me to take some MDMA since she was already rolling. I took 150mg of MDMA at that point and waited patiently for it to kick in. Around 45 minutes later I started feeling the effects of the MDMA, which are quite familiar to me. It must have been 10-15 minutes before I started to feel the effects of the MDA, which I had never taken before. At this point I took another 100mg of each, because I thought that my tolerance was the reason that the effects were so mild. So by my estimate it was an hour and a half to two hours before the MDA kicked in, and it hit me like a freight train. One minute I was talking about how I didn't really feel anything more than the mild rolling feeling, and then I got up from laying on the floor to get a drink and WHAM. The next minute I was having trouble standing up straight and everything I could see was exhibiting light drifting and the fragmented look that edges seem to take on while rolling on ecstacy. For about 30 minutes to an hour I was overwhelmed with an erotic sort of intensity that made me not want to move for a good twenty minutes. The visuals were nice, but they were relatively mild, and typical of psychedelics but not really the focus of the trip, so I won't say anymore about the visuals. The next few hours were filled with wonder and amazement at all things. There was a confidence and optimism that I find hard to reach while sober. The strangest of all of the effects to me was the auditory distortion. I'm a musician, and this is the first time I've had any kind of auditory hallucination, so it was a sort of mind-blowing experience to hear a noticeable difference in all of the sounds I was experiencing. The way I noticed was I put on one of my favorite albums, Cake's Fashion Nugget. It seemed at the time that the sound distortion was only obvious on familiar songs with vocal parts. I didn't notice a difference while listening to Beethoven's 9th and instrumental parts of other songs were hard to differentiate, but voices stuck out as being distinctly slowed down. This was not limited to recorded music, but my voice and my girlfriend also sounded lower than normal. A month or two later I tried another dose of MDA (100mg) with the intention of paying special attention to the auditory aspect of the experience since it had been such an interesting effect the first time, but this dose didn't seem to produce the same pronounced effects. I tried again at the 200mg level, and sure enough all sounds I heard were deeper, the ringtone of my phone, my voice, and the familiar sound of a local DJ's voice were all noticeably lower, though the effects were less profound this time. Mentally I would have to say that the empathy factor was lower than with MDMA, but since I took both and my tolerance was not at base level, I don't really think it's fair for me to judge that. (Revision: now that I've tried MDA alone I would say that the empathetic feelings that are a hallmark of MDMA are not even worth mentioning. I don't feel like MDA would be as useful for interpersonal therapy, though it could still be useful in deprogramming past traumas) My last MDA dose was 200mg, and I felt that it was too much for me to really enjoy. I spent a good portion of the trip trying to get comfortable, but no matter what, I could not find a position or spot that I could be content with for more than a few minutes. Another very present effect was a GREAT reduction in my short term memory. I would be talking with my girlfriend and I would either forget what she was talking about or forget what I was talking about in the middle of a sentence. This could be due to my higher doses. This was not at all conducive to conversation, but I feel that it would be very useful for meditation.

Experience:22mg N-Ethylhexedrone (Hexen) - A (Somewhat) Functional Stimulant at Low Doses,"I smoked marijuana throughout the experience and it greatly enhanced any spontaneous bodily sensations and physical euphoria, as well as reducing the stimulation momentarily. These are notes taken during the experience. 10:10am - Snorted 22mg. 10:15am - I'm feeling the full effects, the come up has started. Stimulation, mild cognitive euphoria and physical euphoria are the most apparent. Increased heart rate is also present. 10:24am - Feel like a plateau/peak has been reached, this would be 14 minutes after dosing. 10:48am - Increased talkativeness, teeth grinding, compulsive redosing is present although I resist and do not redose. 11:02am - Feel like the plateau is on its way out. 11:15am - Still on plateau, focus enhancement is present and am able to get school related things done despite the mild distractions. 11:21am - Time dilation, getting pleasurable tingles 11:45am - Getting cleaning duties DONE, motivation enhancement is present. It's haphazard and scattered housework and school assignments, it is hard to focus the motivation. I would say that this is a 'forceful' stimulant. 12:31pm - I've gotten more stuff done, general motivation is waneing though. I suspect the plateau my be over ~2hours after dosing. 12:41pm - Feeling the energy level lower, seems like I'm exiting the plateau. There is a noticable decrease in stimulation. Compulsive redosing is still present. 1:44pm - Still cleaning off and on, the stimulation is lowering. Gradually coming off the plateau, this is not an abrupt crash but a gradual reduction of effects. 4:08pm - Still feeling mild physical stimulation, such as increased heart rate. 4:50pm - I feel like the mental effects of the snorted dose are done. The lingering stimulation is mild and ignore-able. This experience was meant to determine the duration for insufflated N-Ethylhexedrone and the intensity of the stimulation. At low doses, this substance provided good focus, motivation enhancement, and stimulation to do cleaning related tasks. As the more prominant mental effects wore off, I was still able to channel my focus into getting other things done. This substance made it easier to communicate with others, although in a forced and stimulating manor. The proposed duration for the 22mg experience is: Onset - ~15 minutes Peak/Plateau - ~120 minutes Offset - ~180 minutes After Effects - ~160 minutes Submitted by Fishcenternicole","['focus enhancement', 'increased heart rate', 'increased music appreciation', 'methylphenidate', 'motivation enhancement', 'physical euphoria', 'spontaneous physical sensations', 'stimulation', 'teeth grinding', 'time distortion']",538
Experience:37mg Isopropylphenidate - Getting Shit Done With Isopropylphenidate,"The goal of this trip is to do my laundry, write a 500 page essay, summarize a chapter of history and take a quiz, and do general cleaning activities. This is my first day off, so I took some diclazepam last night as a nightcap for my debaucherous activities. Due to the long half-life I woke up feeling groggy and unmotivated - time for some chemical motivation! I choose Isopropylphenidate to be my study aid for the day. There is also, currently, no nasal ROA dosage information on this substance on this website. I am documenting all of my stimmed out study sessions to better document the dose respondent effects. These are notes taken during the experience. 11am - 11:02 am - dose 27mg nasally. I dont know why, but I've only done nasal ROA with this substance. I should try this orally soon. I begin to do my laundry and the more basic cleaning tasks. The effects are fully present within 2 minutes. 12:24pm - I've made progress on my laundry, but this stimulant is forced with such a large dose at once! I am getting distracted with other things besides what I should be doing while at my desktop PC. I am snorting 10mg more than moving to another location so I can better channel my focus on my studies. 1:16pm - studying, doing laundry, etc. easier to channel the focus in some environments more than others. I dont know if the additional 10mg added to the Focus enhancement or if it was the change of location. 2:08pm - I've gotten a lot of stuff done. I was able to eat a meal around 2pm, this substance does not reduce the appetite even at higher doses. The Focus enhancement is cleaner now, that is an odd dose-response but like I said,it could be due to the change in environment. 3:33pm - Got the assignment AND the quiz done ahead of time. Huh. Analysis enhancement also seemed to work better at higher doses. Perhaps this is due to a possible tolerance, or IPPH just has a weird dose response curve. Overall, Isopropylphenidate is a good (and euphoric) study aid. The stimulation experienced during this trip was very forced and it was easy to get distracted at my desktop PC. However, once I moved to a different area I was able to focus and get a lot more done than I normally would have. The peak effects are very short lived, at least in terms of Cognitive euphoria and Focus enhancement.

"Experience:N,N-Dimethylcathinone:102 mg - A Decent, Functional Stimulant","1:20am: Substance is ingested. 1:30 am: I begin to feel some sort of tingling. 1:50 am: Heartrate feels approximately 1.5x faster, as does breathing. Some hints of mental stimulation. My body temperature feels slightly higher, annoying, but I am in my basement so I do not get too warm. 2:10-5 am: Around this time, I am at the peak of the effects. I begin working. Productivity has received a nice boost. Feels a bit like ethylphenidate, which I find to be a very functional stimulant and optimal for getting things done. Euphoria was mild, just like ethylphenidate, but I was not seeking euphoria so this was not disappointing. Near the end of this time, I begin to notice a bit of neck tension that is mildly uncomfortable. 5-6:30am: It is late and I need sleep. I am moderately mentally tired, albeit still quite physically stimulated. Productivity decreases drastically and I find myself resting in my office chair for most of this time, listening to some quiet music. 6:30+: I am definitely on the comedown, and I take my daily dexedrine, as I know I will have to go to work in an hour, and this seems to have a nice synergistic effect for several hours. I probably stopped noticing effects altogether around 9 am. It has a rather long come down relative to its peak but this was almost certainly because of the dexedrine. This is an interesting chemical. I have to say I had low expectations going into it and N,N-Dimethylcathinone did exceed those. I have a fuzzy memory of Methcathinone years ago, and I do believe N,N-Dimethylcathinone felt relatively similar to it. Would I do it again? Possibly. The gram cost a mere $2, so no holes in my wallet were made obtaining it. All in all a decent stimulant with manageable side effects.

"Experience:10mg EPH - Spontaneous Frank Hallucinations and General ""Dirtyness""","10AM - I remember this was a Saturday shortly before finals, and I needed some stimulant motivation. I decide to weigh out and orally dose 5 mg of ethylphenidate. I wait the usual half hour, eat breakfast, so I don't go Auschwitz mode and start to come up within 30 minutes. 11AM - The effects are not as pronounced as I need them to be, and I dose 5mg more orally. At this point, there was light stimulation and motivation with tinges of cognitive euphoria. My teeth are grinding a little bit. 11:30AM - WHOO BOY, am I stimmed the fuck out. I am jittery, euphoric, and too stimmed out to focus on my differential equations homework. There is a sense of restlessness and euphoria that reminded me of methamphetamine. Feeling to stimmed out to study, I go to my boyfriend's house to smoke some marijuana and chill out. 1PM - Still feeling very stimulated, I take a post-sex shower at my boyfriend's house. While in the shower, I look down and see a motherfucking spider booking it toward me. I remember seeing each individual leg move in succession, the spider was brown and a common wolf spider, it was about 1 in length. THIS IS HOW DETAILED THIS FRANK HALLUCINATION WAS. I scream, and as an arachnophobe, I book it out of the shower completely naked into my boyfriend's room begging him to kill the spider. He comes over to the bathroom, does a thorough search, looks at me, and says ""... what spider?"". I just had a spontaneous frank hallucination on a little dose of EPH with a full nights sleep. I am shaking from this and decided to give the rest of the EPH to my boyfriend, as this is a stimulant that is just too strong for me. 3PM - Coming down a bit, but still feeling stimulated. I take approximately 2mg etizolam to cut the effects short.

Experience:A night with Ethylphenidate,"I woke up and decided to get all the work done, a few days ago I supplemented with Mineral/Vitamin complex, DL Phenylalanine, 5-htp to avoid suffering too much from neurotransmitters depletion. I used 50 mg of ethylphenidate by oral ROA and to kick in another 30 mg insufflated. So T:0 I smoking a cigarette and waiting for it to kick in. It comes on fast, so let's get the job done! I started with house cleaning. I was very fixated on details, and I wanted everything brilliant. From time to time I redosed small bumps of Ethylphenidate and ofc I used my benzos. I got all my manual work done then came shitty paperwork; I keep doing bumps of ethylphenidate, and my jaw is flying around my head now :D. All through the night, i do all my paperwork, but compulsive redosing was still there. I was in brilliant mood so I called my friend and told him I'm coming to check. When i came i washed and polished my car, car of my friend and my friends mum car too :D. My mate knows what's going on, he was just smiling and was joking and said: ""you look like after your first line of meth ever."" We were talking about everything. Sitting in the Bar drinking beers slowly it was time to time pop another pill of ethylphenidate (25 mg tablet). I came home I decided to continue my binge, playing video games chilling, drinking beer, eating some chips and doing bumps ofc! Then came the night, yeah still doing bumps here. Now i proceeded to consume about 800 mg of ethylphenidate. I decided to have some cigarette, i put headphones on (some party dubstep) and then i looked at the sky. I saw lot of shining stars on sky and boooom then it came. I have never experienced this on stims. The stars started to bursting like fireworks, body euphoria is hitting me in waves and i got stuck looking on sky for about 30 minutes. That was incredible! I was amazingly surprised as this had never happened to me on phenidates/amphetamines. It looked very real! But i decided enough was enough and popped my benzos with l-theanine, 10 mg of olanzapine and fall asleep. It shocked me that stars was bursting like fireworks. I woke up relatively fine if a little bit tired. I popped my benzos, had a full meal, Vitamins and took a nap and I was then completely fine.

Experience:500mg 4-FA + 150mg 5-HTP - Irresponsible & unexpected psychedelic,"I was very excited when I got my hands on 2 grams of 4-FA. I had read many reports about it being very MDMA-like, without the loss of lucidity and no horrible comedown. I couldn't wait to try out this new substance, and as I always do on the first try when I trust it, in my own house on my own. Once I had my dinner, I proceeded with weighing out 150mg, putting it in a capsule and chugging it down. The roll came up in a very smooth manner. After an hour and a half I reached peak, and felt as was reported; a very clean roll. No bruxism or speedy feeling at first, just the typical warm MDMA-feeling accompanied by enhanced colors and music. Pupils were only slightly dilated. After another 3 and a half hours the peak obviously subsided and I was left with a state of mind that felt very Modafinil-like. I decided I didn't like it, and so I took what I thought was my first and only 50mg redose. But oh my, the redosing powers are strong with this one. I continued to take another 6 of such doses over the span of almost a full day. The rolls always peaked similarly, but in the end, a peak only lasted a full hour. That's where I decided to call it quits. 3 hours after I felt the peak had subsided, but still felt like on Modafinil, I proceeded to take what I'd take if I want to knock myself out on Modafinil; 1mg Clonazolam and 1mg of Melatonin. This obviously didn't work, so after an hour of trying to get to sleep, I, or rather the C'lam, tried adding 150mg 5-HTP + 150 EGCG, which obviously didn't work as I was still awake another hour after. Then the psychosis struck me. Letters on my screen started floating around. Facebook profile pictures looked like they were taken by a photographer from the Harry Potter. I could swear my cat was running around my room, but when I tried to rub her, she disappeared. LSD like visuals appeared in & out of 'existence'. At the same time, I had a ""sober"" bodyload and mindset, so I was pretty sure I didn't blackout on the C'lam and took some 1P-LSD from my stash. Did still count my psychs though. This effect continued for almost 8 hours, without any redose, except for weed, and still unable to sleep. I eventually took another 0.5mg Clonazolam and 4mg Melatonin in total. This, luckily, did knock me out as I love sleep way too much. I slept for a total of 15hrs and when I woke up, totally sober, I felt a sudden urge to write this report as a warning for everyone who feels like 4-FA isn't empathogenic enough. Don't overdo 4-FA, it's not a regular amphetamine. I love it for what it is, and will start adding a low dose psych, like 2C-B, on the comedown if I want to feel more trippy/empathogenic. But I will never ever redose with 4-FA again, it just doesn't feel right to do so. Submitted by - Bombadil","['colour enhancement', 'increased music appreciation']",713

T+01:42; Stimulation comes in waves following by the classic stim-tight chest feeling. Vasoconstriction is strong in hands and especially a tight vasoconstriction in a wrist i broke 13years ago.

Summary/Rating: Enjoyable, very moreish, i was surprised by the strength of 15mg. would be good pub grub [pub grub is a term for cocaine that you dont mind sharing about due to inexpensivity or low quality]... However, comparing this chemical based on this experience to either cocaine or amphetamines would not surffice. Had an almost cathinone deriative feel to it, less so that all other (m/ethyl)phenidates. Overall the experience was very weak.

Experience:3-MMC: Weak substitute? No way!,"Beforehand I had already been drinking some alcohol and I had used 3-MMC in the past. To me, personally, 3-MMC's effect are exactly what I had imagined cocaine would make me feel. However, cocaine has never been anything special to me, while others really love it. 3-MMC on the other hand, I had read lots of negative things about, but after trying it, it turned out way more fun and pleasant than I had expected. The idea of making a small tripreport regarding 3-MMC appealed to me, because the majority either doesn't know it or has a bad image of it. Prior to consuming the 3-MMC, I drank a few glasses of wine. 23:37 - Line 1.1 - Ever since I started using 3-MMC, the resulting burn in my nose has been getting worse. Because of this, I didn't manage to get it all in, in one hit. 23:39 - Line 1.2 - As soon as the tears from my left eye fade away, I insufflate the second part with the right side of my nose. In under a minute, the first effects are noticable. 23:47 - The effects gradually intensify. A lovely warm, slightly euphoric, energetic and mostly mentally noticable effect is growing inside of me. 23:53 - Leftover - I noticed a small amount of 3-MMC on my mirror and consume it immediately. The effects seem to have reached their peak. The euphoria is definitely close to MDMA's euphoria, but with a clear headspace, instead of clouded with ""love"". I'm feeling heavenly and grab another glass of wine. At this point I'm highly curious of what 4-MMC would be like, because from what I've read this stuff's child's play compared to 4-MMC. It bothers me that I hadn't obtained 4-MMC when it was still readily available, but also that people speak such hateful words regarding 3-MMC. Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm experiencing no heart aches/arythmias nor do I experience anything negative that could be caused by vasoconstriction or high blood pressure. Come to think of it, I'm experiencing no side effects what so ever. 0:13 - I'm experiencing a feeling of mental peace, combined with lasting euphoria. The effect appears to be stable, no declining yet. 0:21 - The feeling is slightly starting to fade away and following D's advice, I'm taking my redose orally. I'm planning on weighing a 100mg parachute and I'll note the time of consumption, of course. 0:37 - 160mg Orally - After asking around on Tinychat, the recommended dose they provided me with was 200~250mg orally at first, with a 150mg redose. Typical me precisely measured 150mg, after which I looked at it and added 10mg. I'm curious, since with this drug, people are way more pleased by the oral effects than insufflating and I was already sold by what it did to me that way! 0:57 - At this point I feel as if I've only bounced the crash off, for now, but I'm not feeling any real high. Should I redose or wait a little longer? 1:07 - Holy shitballs, orally is actually even more relaxed, like people told me! This is great! I'm on a cloud of pleasant mental comfort. Sounds of the series are percieved way more intense. I feel warm and the thought passes my mind that this drug could maybe do good as ADHD medication. 1:15 - Really close to MDMA, while I don't even feel that way after MDMA anymore, ever since I've abused that. This is amazing! Even better than my previous experiences with this substance! I feel warm, comfortable and I've got tiny clouds in my head* en wow! Top notch satisfying! Clammy hands, slight eyewigles. I don't know why I call it tiny clouds in my head, but I feel the need to describe it as such, even though it doesn't make sense. 1:23 - I usually drink way too much ethanol, but the entire craving of wine is suddenly gone. My throat already obstructs everything when I'm only thinking about drinking the last sip of wine from my glass, let alone refill it. I really really meant to say something, but I've completely lost the message. Enjoying the entire world. Turned off the Blacklist, because I wasn't really paying attention to it anyway. 1:41 - Plateau level. Still very pleasant! Fingers are feeling a bit chilled, but I could have left my balcony door open. Otherwise it's probably my bloodflow that's being disturbed. Nothing special, by the way. I experience the same after a night of amphetamine as well from time to time. Currently having a serious, good and personal conversation with F. I'm starting too suspect he's not a Fool, but actually quite the Wiseman. 1:57 - The effects are currently decreasing, of which I'm bummed out, but I have a beautiful picture, to visualize the report a little. FoolCool If only I were good at drawing, I could've created a masterpiece. Now it was only the thought that counted. 2:25 - At this point I feel hollow on the inside. Not really like a crash, but more like a dusty after space. Monday = On-day! 4:43 - I'm just coming out of a very long conversation and I'm coming down now. Well... I'll just redose until tomorrow night! - But my report ends here... Conclusion: The effects are extremely pleasant, definitely, but I do find the drug to be very short actin. If this drug's effects were to last 6~8 hours, I'd be hooked. Now it's just a bit too much redosing for my likings. Insufflated: It burns more and more, which is quite unpleasant, but I've snorted worse. Very fast come-up and a great rush, but very short effects. Orally: The come-up takes a bit longer, but the peak effects stay longer as well. All together, the much preferred ROA. Sidenotes: When insufflating ""too much"" yesterday, compared to what internet sources recommend, the effects were absolutely equally intense and euphoric as MDMA's effects, but only for half an hour. The comedown isn't a sudden crash, but you do sink into a deep deep hole. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS AN IRRESPONSIBLE REPORT, WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO'S A BIT LOST IN LIFE.

Experience:75mg 3-FMA - Perfect Blend of Euphoria and Functionality,"Recent Substance Use: I used 112 mg 5-APB on 3/16/17 - Thursday night. This lasted until Friday afternoon. I also smoked meth at least 2 days out of the past eight since the 5-APB experience. I allergy tested 3-FMA at 500 μg, 3 mg, and 9 mg dosed about four hours apart on Sunday, 3/19/17. Felt nothing out of the ordinary during the tests. Next, I ingested 50 mg 3-FMA at 7 am on Tuesday (3/21/17) morning. This was odd, I was quite busy this morning, and completely forgot I had taken it by the time I got to work, and did not remember until 10:30 am. I did not notice a significant difference from my average mental state at this time of day. I did notice an increase in heart rate however. Upon further reflection, I decided that I was focused enough that I did not notice the effects, but I had received some stimulation from the 3-FMA, as I felt the day had been particularly productive. I chalked it up to my amphetamine tolerance, and thought perhaps 3-FMA is just a bit subtle at lower doses, not pushy like one might experience with an entactogen and whatnot. Friday (3/24/17) night rolls around, and I decide to ingest 75 mg at 8:45 pm. 9:45 pm - I get quite engrossed in a project fixing a computer, this probably around the time I noticed the first alert. I have started pacing a little bit, obviously I have more energy than normal. 10:10 pm - I put on my headphones. Music sounds fantastic, I turned it up to the max. I sit at my computer and begin typing the introduction to this report. 11:12 pm - Quite speedy. I have definitely peaked by this time. It is however a bit much- next time a dose of 65-70 mg would be much better. I am mostly occupied with playing Starcraft 2 and talking with my girlfriend. 1:00 am - I am having a conversation with my girlfriend that has an emotional depth to it that I would not normally have on a stimulant, and it seems highly indicative of some amount of the empathy one might receive from MDMA or 5-APB. This conversation will continue until she falls asleep at around 3:45 am. 3:00 am - I realize my stomach hurts and I need to eat food, but there isn’t much to eat. I scrounge what I can, and feel a bit better for a while, but my girlfriend has fallen asleep, and I do not have as much to distract me from my bodily discomfort. 3:30 am - I notice at this time that everything looks a bit fuzzy, with visual elements that remind me of the subtle entactogenic hallucinations one might get from 3-FEA, 5-MAPB, 4-FA and such. This is interesting, it confirms that it is not a pure stimulant in my opinion, rather, like some may have predicted, it straddles the border between the entactogenic profile of 4-FA and the stimulation of 2-FMA (I have not yet tried 4-FMA, although I have some ready for weekend in the near future). I would also like to make note that the entactogenic effects were not immediate; rather, they followed the stimulation by perhaps a couple hours, not really manifesting until perhaps around 12:30 am if I remember correctly. 4:15 am - Comedown has definitely started, and my stomach is still bothering me quite a bit, so I decide to go lay down. I fall asleep by 4:40 am. 9:30 am - I sleep decently well, and finally awake, eat a breakfast of crepes, and begin to prepare for work. I am nearly baseline now, but there is an energetic afterglow that wakes me up swiftly and I have a sense of excitement for the day ahead, even though I have to go to work at 12:00 pm. I have no noticeable detracting effects from the comedown, but then again, it is rare that I do have a harsh comedown on stimulants, entactogens and psychedelics alike.

Experience:Zopiclone hppd?,"During the summer of 2017, I had discovered a 3 year old bottle of 5mg zopiclone pills at a relative's house. I had heard of zopiclone before then, and at the time I only had access to dxm (which is extremely expensive). Wanting to try it, I took the bottle of zopiclone (I don't recommend doing this). That night I took 3 pills, which was a bad idea being new to zopiclone and gabaergics in general. I do not remember that first experience except for self harming, which is something I hadn't done in many years, and with no apparent reason. After that I began to take it almost daily in the evening, mainy because of boredom. Every time I had used it, I would hallucinate the walls of my room morphing, and often I would see objects moving on their own. Sometimes I would also see something in the air that looked like smoke. During my last trip I took 5 pills (25 mg). That night I had the regular hallucinations, along with bright colored dots, and seeing my carpet have waves and grow like a tiny forest. Strangely I did not experience any withdrawal effects from zopiclone. HPPD symptoms After about a month after my last zopiclone trip, I remember standing outside and seeing visual snow in the sky. Not too long after that, occasionally I started seeing the ""smoke"" I would see on zopiclone. Its been almost two months since the first time I saw visual snow. Currently if I don't focus my eyes, I will immediately see after images. If I stare at something I will begin to see objects morphing and flowing. These effects aren't distressing, although sometimes it makes me anxious when I am trying to sleep.

Experience:60mg Zolpidem - A Delirious Adventure,"First Dose: I decided to try Zolpidem and I was a little bit nervous so I decided to go for a relatively low dose of 20mg. I took the two pills at the same time. About 20 minutes later: I begin to feel a strange but pleasurable euphoric sensation. It felt similar to being tickled but it was very soft. My vision begins to have a subtle change as everything becomes a bit blurry and less detailed in general. My anxious feelings begin to dissolve and I feel a bit sedated. I completely loose track of time: From this point out, time is meaningless. I remember listening to music and dancing... just being a crazy mess. Double vision begins to take over. I was tipsy and walking was kind of a challenge. My heart rate was also higher than it usually is. Second Dose: I was not planning on it, but I took another 40mg, probably around 2 hours after the initial dose. This is where things begin to take a turn. Around an hour after the second dose: I had eaten Taco Bell before any of this happened. I suddenly felt a slight stomach discomfort and I went into the bathroom and threw up. I'm pretty sure I didn't even feel that sick, I pretty much threw up for no reason. It was oddly easy to throw up. I sent my friends a picture of what had just come out of me... no idea why I thought it would be a good idea to show them. By this point, the double vision was solid and unchanging. When I texted my friends, it was hard for me to understand what they were trying to say. Like the words in the text messages didn't come together to make a sentence. I laid in bed and closed my eyes and thought about random scenarios while I heard voices. I don't remember the rest of the night, but looking back at the time stamp on the picture of the vomit, it was probably about 2 AM when I went to sleep.

Experience:Nutmeg (8 teaspoons) - My Mom Introduces Me To Genesis and Other Things,"I felt I might as well contribute my experience with nutmeg for the good of science, as there's very little on nonclassical drugs and home remedies or what have you that I've found on this site. At the time of this experience, I was fifteen years old and my only experience with all drugs was with a lot of Adderall which I was prescribed to and a lot of Oxycodone and Tramadol which my father was prescribed to about a year before, and had decided to leave sitting around and going to waste. Both were no longer a part of my life and being yet to enter into the ""dope game,"" or to discover DXM, I was desperately searching for ways to get high. I believe I had tried smoking several sorts of tea as well, namely Kava, Sage, and Peppermint. I was home alone when I devoured eight teaspoons of nutmeg with huge difficulty. I recall it tasting like powdered Pepsi, cola flavor concentrated and consumed in excess. It was not very good nor would I put it on my egg nog. I'd heard it can take up to four hours to kick in so I waited four hours and experienced absolutely no effect. Add twenty more hours. It is the next day now and my mom wants me to help her figure out Youtube because a friend told her about it and she didn't realize it has a ton of music. I say, oh sure, I'm listening to music with Youtube all the time, don't you see me? So I say, what song do you want? She says, Firth of Fifth by Genesis. I've never heard of it, but I type it in and start the song and recognize the voice of the singer. This is the guy who sings in Tarzan, she tells me, you like Tarzan right? Yeah, I think, Tarzan's the king of the jungle. All human beings want to do when they come to the jungle is be king of the jungle, but at least he did it right. I suddenly decide that this is the best, and I mean best, song that I've ever heard. It's so long and intricate, it becomes myriad other songs and returns to the original when you least expect it. At the time I'm into dubstep and house music, so you can't really blame me for being amazed by the quality of Genesis. I feel really sleepy, but in a good way, I feel like everything is perfect and excellent. I feel a deep kinship with the creators of Firth of Fifth, and later that other song in which he's a lawnmower, can't remember the name. My mom asks, why are your eyes so red? The happy sleepy feeling has progressed to something immense and crushing. I'm upstairs on the couch trying to take a nap before my brother and sister and sister's boyfriend arrive so we can all go to a drive-in movie together. I figure if I get some sleep I'll feel better before they arrive, but I can't get to sleep. Instead, I'm seeing strangely shaped after-images in the darkness. I find myself in the basement again, where the computer and Youtube and Genesis are, unsure of how I got there. My sister and her boyfriend arrive. I can't remember if my brother is home or if he comes with them. My sister knowingly looks at my eyes, and by this time it's sort of subtly been established that she smokes cannabis from time, but it's never even remotely been a thing that we could share. Somehow it just doesn't work that way. We find some eyedrops and I put them in but my eyes are always bone dry moments later. The ride takes what seems like years, the air conditioning is burning my eyeballs and I keep slipping in and out of consciousness, looking out of the window and having mini-seizures. Strange convulsions. My brother tells me in the dark it looks like I'm shooting up in my eye. Everyone laughs about this, but I've forgotten how to laugh. Everything has become completely humorless. My sensory appreciation is turned way up but I can't cooperate with it because I'm too scared of what the others are thinking and can't hold a thought for very long. We stop at my sister's boyfriend's place and I trip multiple times trying to climb the stairs to his apartment. Everyone has pushed my condition under the rug and it's gotten really awkward. He shows me a song he's been working on via keyboard and guitar, and it's terrific, I love it, but I don't know how to express that, and his crestfallen look kills me. We reach the movie and my sister and I sit out on lawn chairs next to the car with a jumbo bag of potato chips. I eat until my mouth feels gritty and raw. I eat compulsively without thinking, and the movie is the final Harry Potter, and it all seems like a dream. With any other drug, I would be coming down by the time the second movie comes on, which is called Horrible Bosses, but instead, I'm continuing to come up. My eyes are still dry and painful, and my hunger will not subside. My sister purchases a large popcorn, telling me to wait here while not explaining why she doesn't want me to come to concessions with her. I recall sitting in the back of the car and speaking with her boyfriend. It's been hours and hours now, and he says, at first I thought you might be high, but your eyes are still really red after all this time, I mean I'm not your dad or anything. And so it goes. I devour the popcorn, I can't recall going home and going to bed. The following day I'm still incredibly high from dawn till dusk. We have a sort of family gathering and that's awkward as well but for some reason much more difficult to remember. The day after I finally come down. Several times past I try to recreationally use nutmeg again, planning out the next couple of days, to no avail. It seems you have to be blasted into smithereens or else no effects whatsoever. If one is to use nutmeg I would recommend one has multiple days to oneself, and to aim high, and to expect to be very far above where you're aiming. Imagine you eat straight cannabis butter out of a tub like ice cream, take a low dose of DPH, and a couple of shots of strong liqueur. All in all it's pretty good, though. I just wish I could have laid in bed the whole time and listened to binaural beats or something. With proper planning I do think it has exploratory potential.

Experience:190mg Mirtazapine - Comparable high to common dose Vicodin,"Last night I attempted 120mg~ but fell asleep and failed to notice anything except the difficulty swallowing. T+00:00 Took 20x7.5mg tablets (150mg), then took a shower. I also drank Yerba Mate which has a moderate amount of caffeine. T+00:30 I start having a bit of jitters, probably from the caffeine. I also feel like I see things moving or flashing around me. T+00:43 I start feeling very lightweight and the jitters have gone away. I try and take a drink of water but then stand up and almost spit it out because of the difficulty swallowing. My heart was beating fast but it eventually got slower. My fitness watch cannot determine my heartrate. T+00:56 Still no CEVs or anything else very exciting. T+01:02 Seeing a drifting effect where it seems like I'm looking at everything atop a slightly shaky glass pool of water. I believe I heard a man say ""what the heck was that"" T+01:04 Now my watch has read my heartrate: 75bpm. That's relatively good and I'm enjoying the music that I'm listening to as well. T+01:08 I'm now seeing a moderate amount of tracers. T+01:23 Playing video games, still have mild euphoria and body high. T:01:47 Seeing objects in different ways, like there's faces or animals in objects around my room. T+03:00 Going to redose five more (7.5mg) pills, I suspect the lack of significant effects was because of the tolerance I quickly built up last night as well as the night before (normal dose for dream experimentation.) T+03:30 I had an overwhelming urge to eat, almost exactly the same as cannabis. The food tasted much better than sober. T+04:38 Still only mild euphoria + body high. I'd say it's almost the same buzz I'd have on 20mg of Vicodin, very warm and fuzzy feeling; This may be related to the k3 opioid receptor interaction? I stopped taking journal entries from here on, the buzz gradually got weaker as my day finished","['appetite enhancement', 'auditory hallucination', 'bronchodilation', 'cognitive euphoria', 'effect::drifting#morphing', 'increased music appreciation', 'perception of bodily lightness', 'sedation', 'sleepiness', 'spontaneous bodily sensations', 'tracers']",465
"Experience:120mg - Unexpected 'trip', insane CEVs","I didn't know Mirtazapine was a deliriant at the time, and as a sufferer of anxiety and depression, I guess I was just hoping for a more pronounced anxiolytic effect the next morning. I looked up the highest does of Mirtazapine given clinically, made sure it was well below the LD50 and all that and downed 120mg. Within 2 minutes of ingestion, I was almost knocked out in my chair after taking them. This stuff hits incredibly fast without any tolerance. I hobbled to bed, and barely made it without falling over, then I was lying there feeling drunk and dizzy, I got that feeling where you feel like you are floating/spinning around when lying in your bed, but aren't moving, it was fun so I tried to stay awake lying there, but after a minute or so my eyes got too heavy and I closed them. Around then I started hearing people talking, it sounded as if people were in my bedroom. I couldn't hear what they were saying, but it was 'clear', yet I couldn't make out any words. The noise of these people talking would 'move' around my room, and sound as if it were coming from different locations in my room, all this happening very quickly for about 1 minute. In front of my behind-eye vision, it was as if I was looking at something directly in front of me, as if my eyes were open - it was the most surreal thing ever, it was like when I closed my eyes, they became a portal to another reality where I was seeing things through my eyes, and everything in front of me seemed real, but when I opened them it snapped me back to my bed. Then, I heard a loud high-pitched noise, like a flashbang grenade in an FPS, and at the same time, a bright white light appeared in the center of my closed eye vision, as the sound got louder the light got brighter until the sound went away and the light disappeared. After that, there were images behind my eyelids, detailed, completely random images of various things, I actually can't remember a single one specifically anymore, but for example sake: An image of a kettle, then a farm, then a couple of people talking, then some books, etc etc, just totally random, un-connected things. And these images were appearing incredibly fast - I could 'see' the image, and before I could even process what it was in my mind, and begin to think about it, at least 10 more images had passed by my eyes, and yet I could still somehow see each image and recognize what it was, it was so surreal. After a couple of minutes of this, the images stopped and I fell asleep. As soon as I woke up, I remembered everything, except for the images I saw, I just know that I saw them, and how I was thinking at the time how crazy it was that I was seeing hundreds if not thousands of completely random, disjointed images at such a fast pace.

Experience:700mg Diphenhydramine trip,"DISCLAIMER!!!* I do not recommend taking this much of anything OTC. I did it stupidly attempting to sleep one night sick as hell with the flu. This was not an intentional ""trip"" or planned out by any means, and I had no idea what was about to happen. Generally, I love psychedelics, but remember kids, this is a ""deliriant"" which means you're basically having the worst nightmare of your life while awake. If you're going to do it, have a sitter present, and be prepared for what's to come. Happy hallucinating!* I couldn't sleep to save my life. I was in withdrawal from opiates (generally pain pills, which is an entire other story all together) AND sick with the flu/chest cold. I decided that taking a few sleeping pills would help me get a few hours of sleep. After about an hour, it wasn't working, so I took more, and more, and ending up taking the entire packet of 12, I could have sworn I took two more, but I don't know? About a half hour later, I went to stand up to use the bathroom, and everything had a strange feel to it. The room was suddenly darker and felt like something bad was about to happen. People didn't look right, things were alien in shape, ordinary things looked wrong and menacingly shaped. There was a constant black gellous ball that would be nearby. My legs and arms felt 1000lbs and I had the worst metallic taste in my mouth. I remember saying ""Guys this isn't right."" and my friend thinking nothing of it. I walked into the bathroom, where I proceeded to attempt to throw them all up because I realized something wasn't right. Yeah. That wasn't working so well. The pills came up but what was left of them. They were basically already ""gellified"" into my body and there was nothing I could but ride it out. I realized this somehow in all my horrific shit but knowing I was hallucinating and it was simply a reaction still wasn't calming me down any because I thought I was going to die after that. I'll tell you what I remember. I sit down on the floor, attempting to relax but I look up and the digital clock is just counting up minute by minute, and it gets faster and faster until it starts going backward and ended up on 6:66. I swear to God I thought of that movie 1408 because it had just came out not long before that. This must have been where I fucked up. I remember saying ""No, no no!"" and terrified of what was to come, because I took that as where my trip really went downhill. It was almost like my brain was warning me with the clock. UGH. There was a woman I could see out of the corner of my eye, she was haggard, bloody, and wearing all white. For whatever reason, she kept asking me something and I couldn't make it out. I would get up to walk over to her, and when I'd get closer, she'd just evaporate away and reappear somewhere else. I was seeing children sitting in closets swinging around holding hands and then they would look at me and laugh. I kept thinking my friends were there when they weren't. I'd see Dan over in the corner doing routine shit like playing his guitar or singing a song or just sitting there, in the dark. I'd be like ""What are you doing, Dan?"" and every time I'd walk over to him, I would touch the back of his head and he would disappear. I moved on to a completely different existence after that. I can't even remember most of it because I literally went to another place. I thought I had died and this was hell. Just a constant feeling of a thousand people really close to my face and shadows behind me. I called my Mom, but what I said to her was nothing like what I imagined or remember. The convo went something like this to me ""Mom, I took too many sleeping pills and I'm seeing shit"" Mom: Oh that's your own fault. Drink some water. Take a deep breath. Try to get some sleep. There is no point in going to the ER because they'll just pump your stomach and you don't want that."" I seriously believed this was what she said up until a few weeks ago when we started talking about it and she tells me ""Anna, that's not what you said!"" and I was like ""You're kidding me. What did I actually say?"" She said I told her that my ex was ""perpendicularly horizontal to the wall and the bed."" and ""he's levitating"" and apparently went off about levitating people and how ""there isn't anything to him, it's like he's clear and I can see thru him"" and apparently ""everyone is dissolving into shit"" which that one I can kind of understand because it was almost like everyone and everything was 2D and there was no mass to them or anything. Like if someone were to sit down on the couch, they would have became a part of the couch (almost like a picture printed on a t-shirt, if you can picture that hahahaha)That conversation went down nothing like what I remember. After that, I managed to make it to the bedroom, where I laid down, only to hear the sound of music playing far away. It was like a radio was on and I couldn't find where it was coming from. That's when the spiders started. Quite frankly, I'm surprised it took this long because from what I've read from others reactions to this shit, they happen almost immediately. Well, these little bastards were forming out of the fuzz on the bed. Anything. Cat hair, fuzz, strings, etc. They would turn into this medium sized, black and brown spider with these clear, almost ""fishing line"" legs. I'd go to touch one because I had a terrible case of the ""touch everything and it disappears"" so every time I did, it would reappear somewhere else, and bring ten more with him. They never really bothered me much, except they would crawl on me, but after an hour of insisting to my ex that there were ""spiders in the bed and I'm not imagining it"" I started to just get tired of fighting them off and tried to ignore them. The kaleidoscope of shit that was going on when I closed my eyes was insane. That was probably the only nice part about this entire hallucination. The only time I didn't like having my eyes closed was when a face would bum-rush me out of the visuals and scare my eyes open. While laying there trying to fall asleep, I saw Barbie Dolls sitting on the tops of each door frame, and they were lined up, and they would all turn and look at me and kick their feet which for some reason was hilarious to me and didn't frighten me at all, in fact, it was probably the nicest thing they could have done! After that, I'd just keep seeing shadow people, and people outside my window looking in, people the closet, and more friends that weren't really there. At this point, I was able to finally fall asleep, and when I woke up the next morning, I must have only gotten 4 hours but the hallucinations weren't nearly as bad anymore. The spiders were still there for a few minutes, but they would just crawl back into the blankets and they were eventually gone for good. The last hallucination was my friend, Chris, peeking his one eye thru the crack of the bedroom door, and when he saw me, he smiled and asked me if I wanted to visit again soon and I got up to open the door to push him out and he disappeared. After that, things were back to normal. I managed to not suffer any serious repercussions from that one, and I'm glad to say I haven't had any ""withdrawals"" since that time because I'm now 6 years clean from the dangerous crap. :-) As always, please be safe about your journeys to the other world. Sometimes they can be scary. I don't know how it would feel to go into a DPH trip KNOWING the outcome. I'm sure you could make it nicer and a little easier to handle with the proper setting and mind.

Experience:700mg - Joining the 700 club,"This is a 700 mg dose of DPH taken at night in a dimmed room. Anyways, I'll start with the first time I joined the 700 club, I took 700 mg of DPH at night with the lights dimmed, I layed in my bed and after not too long the first physical effects take hold, I get up and I notice it feels like gravity was turned up 50 times, its very hard to move, and it feels like your carrying weights on your ankles. The second physical effect I noticed was a rapid drying of the mouth and mucous membranes, and slightly upset stomach (but thats from eating 24 pills). Slowly the cognitive effects and the other physical effects begin to take hold, the physical effects experienced at this point are the previous ones only more intense and total loss of fine and gross motor control, slurred incoherent speech, sensitivity to light, sound, and especially sudden stimuli (like its 10 times easier to jump and get startled, and often happens from the hallucinations), strange sensations of electric shock (I had my laptop battery on the bed and I was totally conviced it had shocked me) extreme sedation, often to the point where you cant keep your head up even while walking. So as if the frequent urination isn't enough, its also a stop and go deal, meaning you have to force it out in short bursts even though it seems like you could stand there forever. This is also another thing I don't see many people discuss, and I'm not entirely sure the reasoning behind it, but everytime I'd look at the toilet it had more intense visual static and movement then ANY other object, and this was VERY consistent during the 7 times I did it, the toilet bowl was just buzzing with movement and visual snow/black spider dots. Alright, so I get back in my room and I lay down and I see a rat in my closet, so I start freaking out because I see this solid rat and I keep blinking and its still there, so I go to the other room dizzy and confused trying to find my cat because it seemed logical at the time to bring my cat in to take care of the rat, anyways I thought I saw my cat but it was the shadow of the lamp, I then fell down and slowly regained my balance, once I got back to my bedroom the rat was STILL there so that really was freaking me out, but for some reason I guess I sorta forgot about it because I layed back down then I remembered it and looked over and the ""rat"" was a damn slipper, I then realize I just tried to chase down my cat to get rid of a hallucination. So I'm just like, fuck this shit, and dose out into a rapid REM like dream state that is extremely vivid, to the point where when someone talks to you and expects you to respond you often answer in real life, and as a result snap back into reality, often finishing a jumbled nonsensical sentence, this repeats itself over and over one vivid microsleep hypnagogic state after the other until either a hallucination wakes you up or you have to piss. These ""REM like microsleep daydreams"" are very similar to hallucinatory states found on LSA but instead of lucidity its delerium. They are different then hallucinatory states found on other drugs like ayahuasca however as they didn't seem to draw on concepts that weren't already present in a persons life, and usually it everyday actions and conversations, as opposed to the wild and mystical landscapes of other hallucinatory states. When you weren't flipping through mundane situations in a completely realistic way, you where staring at the ceiling, because it caused more intense visual drifting then psychedelics do, however many times more blurry and ill defined, however due to this blurriness it appears to be more depth defying, however psychedelics produce a greater form of this distortion, the dph form is more noticeable and I guess you'd say realistic, this is also accomponied by objects drifting from their present location and totally shifting and distorting form and shape in an extremely fluid fashion. This also is accomponied by wild flowing of wood grain and certain textures, this again while isn't as intricate and detailed as psychedelics, was more noticeable, inescapeable and realistic. Pictures frames would also wildly bend and distort in a fluid fashion thats more similar to mushrooms then lsd or dxm. I haven't even gotten to the spiders yet. I have seen so many forms of different spiders on DPH, one time a yellow/black spider came down right in front of my face just floating mid air, and of course theres the famous black dots that race across non stop that people like to call ""spiders"", these dots look exactly like the black dots you see when you get lightheaded and ""See stars"" as they call it, I've seen these dots cover entire surfaces, and they dance about in a very random pattern, and the thing is that isn't like most other hallucinations, you can stare at these dots and follow them with your eyes and they never really go away. One thing I have to say though is DPH probably has the absolute worst HPPD of the other hallucinogens, after 7 times It took nearly 2 years before I stopped seeing spots and visual snow constantly in my vision, and even then it pretty much just got replaced by LSD HPPD, I can still see the snow if I really look, especially if I'm high. I have also seen my brother morph out of the top corner of my ceiling in full realism, had my mother walk in even though my friend owned the house I was in, so I was naturally like WTF are you doing here. I don't smoke Cigs but I've had phantom bowls, OH another one of the WEIRDEST hallucinations I get on DPH and this is a big one, I have a tv that doesn't even have cable plugged into it in my bedroom, and this is pretty consistent for me, I remember laying there consistently watching tv a great deal with full audio that seemed to sync up with the visual broadcast, before I realize that tv isn't even plugged in, that one always got me when I did DPH. Another one is flying insects like mainly wasps, I always saw wasps. They would swarm and buzz and pounce at my ceiling, and I even heard them true. The thing with dph Is the hallucinations freaked me out so much, I got into the habit of using a camera to take pictures to verify if its even real, and on atleast one occasion I hallucinated the hallucination it the picture aswell...because next day I looked at the same pic and it was blank. I've also walked into rooms and just stood there blanking out into nothingness. Ok I actually can handle and enjoy the solid indifferentiable from reality hallucinations, and I enjoy the almost psychedelic like distortions, but what I can NOT stand is the physical and cognitive effects, the visuals however are pretty neat. I just wish It didn't have those other effects attatched, those include; Total lack of emotion, like I'm not totally terrified of the hallucinations because I have like a poker face the entire time, and its total lack of emotion at best. The whole impending doom and depression thing, I took such high doses that I was so zonked out I was pretty much a zombie, I was barely really in my body enough to feel it. I also get very high auditory hallucinations, I think the only thing that even came close in terms of auditory effects was 25c-NBOME or San Pedro (mescaline). Actually, I remember how my trips used to usually go on dph, I would get the microsleep then hallucinatory states then dysphoria made it so I couldn't stand it, but eventually there was a point where the dysphoric effects went away but the hallucinations where still present. But btw this drug has a terrible hangover, it leaves you feeling edgey, lethargic, and drained the whole next day and it kind of reminds me of a stimulant comedown, but the day after I would also often breakout into swarms of black dots. I felt normal the day after that though.

"Experience:Diphenhydramine (650 mg, Oral) - Midnight walk","Dose was administered at approximately 10 pm, the dose was made up of 26 25mg Benadryl tablets washed down with Coca Cola. 10:10, The initial effects began around 10 to 20 minutes after dosing, I noticed subtle morphing of the carpet and couch, I felt tired and heavy at this point but was able to urinate without problem. 10:30, At this point I began to see glints of light with no obvious source on the walls and my vision was noticeably darkened giving everything a gloomy appearance. I no longer felt tired and instead felt wide awake and fully aware of my surroundings, anxiety had actually decreased at this point from when I dosed and I laid back to watch the light show on the wall. 10:45, the glints of light had become far less subtle, I would compare it to reflections off a phone screen but much larger. 11:00, I started to see what looked like wisps of smoke at random throughout the room. 11:20, I decided to go for a walk around the neighborhood to see if a change of environment would give me more opportunity to hallucinate, when I left I was listening to music in my headphones more loudly at the recommendation of a friend to keep from being spooked too badly by auditory hallucination. I also had lit up a cigarette hoping to use it to keep some grasp on reality if I did reach a delirious state. 11:25, I was a good ways down the main street that runs through the neighborhood and had definitely noticed some auditory hallucinations despite the music, I don't remember the sounds well but distinctly remember comparing them in my head to balloons popping and banging pots, the sounds always seemed to come from behind me, I would imagine if anyone had seen me at this point I would have looked insane walking so quickly and checking behind me so often. 11:30, I blew out a large cloud of smoke and watched it follow alongside me at the same speed I was moving for a while, I was startled when it abruptly changed color from a lighter blueish grey to a dark grey almost black but still visible against the night sky. Also around this time I without any warning or nausea keeled over and began vomiting, it flowed smoothly and without any effort, it actually felt pleasant. I also kept noticing movement in my peripheral vision but there was never anything there when I looked. I comforted myself by thinking it was a friendly spirit guiding me on my walk and ensuring no danger would come to me. 11:35, I reached the corner of my street and noticed movement in the backyard of a house through the fence, I began looking at the movement and realized there was a pale white face moving up and down in a jittery unnatural fashion while looking at me, I also noticed this figure was waving their hands in the air. I was unnerved by this and quickly walked away unsure of whether I should keep looking at it to make sure it wouldn't follow me or to look away and hopefully have it vanish upon looking back, I ended up looking away when I felt I was at a safe distance but was too afraid to look back. 11:40, there isn't much to say for most of the walk back, I had finished my first cigarette at some point before this and decided to light another, I was too focused on trying to light it in the mild wind that I didn't pay attention to my surroundings until I was almost back. 11:45, when I reached by street I realized the entire street up until my house had no functional street lamps, I was apprehensive about walking the road but my desire to be safe in my bed eventually won out and I started walking up the dark street 11:50, I started paying attention to the trees in the yards of the houses and noticed shadowy figures peeking out from one side and then moving behind the tree and popping to look at me from the other side in an almost playful fashion, I remember thinking they were too shy to come out and maybe they wanted to see me but were afraid themselves or maybe afraid that they would scare me. Upon reaching my door I decided I wanted to finish my cigarette and sort of walked circles around the cul de sac not even thinking that the neighbors could potentially see me, I also had a third cigarette hoping it would help me calm down before returning to my bed and walked up the street in the other direction to take my time and enjoy it. I heard several more auditory hallucinations some of them even being in the nature of voices but didn't see anything strange until I passed by a bush and heard an unrealistically loud rustling sound even through my music, I looked at the bush thinking maybe an animal had seen me coming and hid inside but I couldn't see any animal just the bush moving like there was something inside, whether or not this is a hallucination I was unable to determine. After finishing my last cigarette for the night I walked back into my house noticing several dark faces peeking over my fence before I rushed in the door. 12:00, I considered grabbing food from the fridge but despite now having an empty stomach due to vomiting I realized I didn't have any appetite and instead got a glass of water thinking if I stayed hydrated my body would have an easier time metabolizing the Benadryl. 12:10, Having made myself comfortable in bed I laid back and watched the room trying to see if I could notice anything, several abnormalities I encountered were partially formed but three dimensional transparent figures pacing my room and sometimes approaching me, these figures were only noticeable because they slightly distorted the light passing through them not much unlike ""The Predator"" (from the movies) while camouflaged, I also recall them appearing to interact with objects in the room but only in subtle ways, like small fragments of paper moving as they walked by and the carpet being disturbed when walked over by them. 12:20, I remember a good while after getting comfortable becoming afraid to look at the windows after seeing faces looking back at me, the room was well lit so hallucinations were not easily noticeable but the darkness outside allowed them to form just fine. 12:30, I decided to chat with some friends over the phone but found it increasingly difficult as I started experiencing blurriness and double vision when looking at objects up close, I was able to use the phone fine when I closed one eye at a time but this action also made the blurriness and double vision worse each time I tried opening both again. I opened my phone camera to see what I looked like and was disturbed by seeing myself with my eyes crossed, I've always had difficulty crossing my eyes intentionally so seeing myself like that without effort made me wonder if I would be stuck like that. With a lot of effort and focusing on farther away objects I was able to make my eyes uncross and my double vision was reduced for the time but not gone. 12:45, A friend of mine I had an argument with earlier in the night came into my room to visit, I was fairly certain at the time that this is real and not imagined, they were staying the night at my house and had good reason to come talk but after reading some more trip reports from others I'm not so certain. I don't remember the exact topic of the conversation but I remember that I wasn't hallucinating for the time, focusing on socializing was enough to get my brain off formulating images for me it seems, I do remember being forgetful and having a hard time remembering the questions they asked me and I would sometimes lose my thought mid sentence and trail off, this was disorientating and gave me some anxiety. They left not long after and I was back to focusing on the transparent people walking around my room. 1:00, Despite being afraid I'd slip into a coma or die in my sleep I decided around this time I was tired of watching the same visuals and would turn off the lights and get to sleep, I turned my back away from the rest of the room so I wouldn't get scared by anything I saw then closed my eyes and laid still hoping I'd fall asleep, this took a while and I remember it was difficult but I didn't have anymore hallucinations auditory or visual until I fell asleep. 7:30, I woke up for the first time out of extreme thirst, I finished off my glass of water and fell back asleep 11:30, I woke up for the day, I felt weak and tired, I felt a mild pain in my side and this concerned me because I know DPH can be hard on the liver but this vanished quickly after standing up and I believe it was dehydration related. Aftermath, throughout the day I had a noticeably harder time with memory and attention, I'd forget details and often whole conversations, I'm assuming this is temporary and has to do with DPHs Anti-Cholinergic properties, Acetylcholene having to do with memory if I recall correctly. I also felt groggy throughout the day and never fully woke up to the extent I usually do. I found this trip interesting as I didn't break through into full delirium and was still able to differentiate between what was real and imagined but still had some memorable hallucinations. I also had a recurring fear throughout the next day, likely unrelated to the effects of the DPH that I had died in my sleep and was experiencing an afterlife or dream but was able to rationalize my way out of those thoughts.

Experience:550mg-Bugs All Around Me.,"I left my boxing lesson at Night to go home and midway home I thought to myself that I'll probably be bored and I should experiment with Benadryl. I have done it in the past at 400mg and that was a very interesting trip so I decided to add an extra 150mg. I head to my local RiteAid and buy the Benadryl. I am not sure if the lady knew what I was up to but she just went on with her business. I get home and dose my self a few hours later. T+0:00 I dose myself with 550mg of Diphenhydramine and resume talking to a friend on Discord. T+0:30 I do not really feel anything major at this time but I am starting to feel a bit weird. It’s like my hand feel very light weight and they shortened in length. I remember feeling this on my first trip at 400mg so I know I was coming up. T+1:00 Hallucinations are starting to form at this point. The corners of my room became darker and some objects would become larger if I stare at them for some time. T+1:20 The Hallucinations have kicked up a notch and the Drifting is more profound now. I also start to see inanimate objects become autonomous. I have a marble spider hanging off my ceiling and it would start to move like it was alive. T+2:00 Shadow people are becoming more apparent, tall ones, they’re about 8 feet tall. They do not look hostile, they seem to not be aware that I exist. T+2:20 At this point, I am hearing my mother and her friend chatting loudly downstairs when my Mom is sleeping and it’s about 1 - 2 AM. It sounds so real though, I even heard one of them coming upstairs. I also start to see tiny spiders on my arm if I stare at it. T+2:45 I stare at my right forearm and I start to see my fist to look like a toy that’s disconnected from my wrist. Then I saw a large red bug crawl on me, looked like a mix of a Cockroach and Ladybug. I start to see papers on the floor move on their own and slightly hover in the air whilst vibrating intensely. T+3:00 I start to see spiders on my curtains, small ones the same color as my curtains. After a while, they start to crawl and some launch onto me. The spiders only occur when the room is dark. When I look at myself in the mirror, I start to see thorns growing out of me and my eyes start bleeding. I look completely deformed in the mirror. Music sounds amazing, it just has this extra emotion to it and it sounds faster due to the drowsiness. T+3:45 A clusterfuck of spiders on my curtains now. One giant one the size of my palm and hundreds of small ones. Crawling over my curtains and some launching at me. They go away as I turn my mini lamp on. T+4:00 I saw a ghostly figure of a Firefighter with a blocky right arm walk through my door and towards me. Disappearing once it got to close. I also see hands behind me in my peripheral. A toy dinosaur my brother starts to move its head and tail. It looks so real. T+4:30 I am overwhelmed and I decide to go to sleep and the restless leg syndrome is the worst. I also seem to have a very weird internal hallucination. It’s like I’m in a park and I can fly. However, the people around me seem very real and I have full on conversations with them and I open my eyes and realize I hallucinated an entire park filled with families. I thought I was actually there. T+5:00 Saw an old female at my door, she had a smile on her face, a lovely one and started to change the position of the light switch all over the wall. I also notice my door opening on its own and would close once I blink. Meanwhile it is open, I would see a shadow person with glowing eyes that aren’t so bright. Moving around the hallway. I do not remember the rest but the hallucinations seemed so real, I eventually fell asleep and woke up feeling like shit.

Experience: 550mg DPH - My First Time on DPH,"I was inspired to try this drug after reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. I loved the way that the lines between reality and fantasy were completely blurred. So I bought a 200 pill bottle of dye-free, 25mg, CVS-brand Diphenhydramine. I knew that I should wait until I was with my trip-sitter to try it for the first time but I was too excited. So I decided to start with a small dose of 150mg. Below is my report in real time as I took this fascinating drug. 4:41pm: Just took 150mg of diphenhydramine HCL. This is my first time trying it so I wanted to be sure and start slow. I’ll be trying my best to keep from falling asleep. I’ll check back at 5pm and every thirty minutes after. Wish me luck. 5:30pm: Alright, so it’s been almost an hour. I can still type just fine. I feel very odd. Still not sure it it’s a placebo or if the drugs are actually causing it. I think auditory hallucinations are starting. I kept hearing the text tone from my phone. But that’s happened to me in the past so I’m not reading much into it yet. The main thing is I’m very very tired. Gonna watch Hunger Games to try and stay up. Love you all, I’ll check back at 6pm. Also I’m having some trouble typing. I think it may be starting to kick in. 6:00pm: All the effects appear to have ceased. I guess I took far too little. I’m taking 100 more mg. I’ll let you know how it goes. I’ll check back at 6:30pm or until something mildly interesting happens. 6:30pm: Definitely starting to feel some effects. My skin feel very very warm and I got a feeling that I’m really unable to describe. The best way would be to describe it as shocks of electricity starting at one of my extremeties and moving their way toward my head. It wasn’t altogether unpleasant. Almost euphoric. Only in a different way. A way that makes it hard to tell if it feel good or not. 6:43pm: Okay so now it’s starting to hit me. The indescribable feeling is more intense now. I feel like I saw my hand turn red out of the corner of my eye but when I looked at it it was a normal color. Gonna go pee now because I may not be able to later. Wait the urge went away. I’ll try anyway. I had no trouble peeing. My legs and arms are very heavy. When I see my leg under the blanket it moves on its own and I forget it’s a leg. Much less my leg. Started watching Alice in Wonderland (the latest one). Hopefully it doesn’t aggravate any hallucinations I might have. I feel almost drunk. Very different, but still impaired. 7:05: Something interesting happened while I was outside smoking (cigarettes) but I can't remember what. I made a point to write it down too. I’ll let you know if it comes back to me. Also very mild hallucinations: I keep seeing things underlined in red. The red goes away when I look directly at it. Also feelings like there are bugs crawling on my skin under my clothes. When I tried to brush them off they disappear. Indescribable feeling is in my legs now. I’ll keep you updated. 7:18pm: Still not getting what was I was hoping to get. Took 100 more mg. Listening to Black Sun. What a pretty song. Still really sleepy but I think I can manage. Also have a fast heartbeat and mild trembling. Still really hot. 7:25pm: So this is interesting. I actually feel like I’m mildly tripping. It’s getting very hard to focus. Also my right ear feels like it’s leaking. 7:37pm: Keep forgetting things right after I think them. I had more to say but I can’t remember. Ironic. 7:42pm: It’s getting really dark in here. Except not really dark. It just feels really dark. Like somebody dimmed my eyeballs. 7:56pm: Still no trouble peeing. I feel like the effects are wearing off. I loved the feeling but I was really looking forward to hallucinating. I’ll make another entry if anything interesting happens. 8:16pm: Don’t know how people say this drug isn’t fun. This gets me higher than weed. Still no hallucinations. I’m upset. 8:22pm: Very short memory. I’ll be watching my movie and listening to conversations and then realize I don’t remember what they were talking about. Getting difficult to read. 8:47pm: Just took 100mg. That’ll be my last try. Next time I’ll try a lot more next time. 9:01: Definitely starting to lose my motor skills. I keep accidentally clicking things on my trackpad. Still able to type just fine though. 9:17: So far the most annoying thing is forgetting what I’m doing or what I was just thinking. It almost happened while I was getting ready to type this but OMG hallucinations finally. I see smoke trailing up out of my laptop. It’s weird though it doesn’t rise it just wiggles around. My hand is moving. Just forgot what I was going to say afterwards. Damn it I’m back to normal. Definitely taking more next time. 9:23: just started thinking about scars. No idea how it came up. 9:27: The ceiling light just talked to me. Started dreaming with my eyes completely open. It felt like a daydream but I didn’t have control. Now the shadows from the ceiling fan are growing. One of them is almost to the wall. Hallucinations are getting more intricate. The shadow from one of the fan blades is completely solid, 3d, and its jerking like a guy on Tourette’s. Daydreaming a lot. I don’t remember closing my eyes but for some reason I feel like they did. 9:39pm: I know I said last time was my last time but I really want to see more hallucinations. Preferably something more interesting than a fan quivering or a visible breeze visible in my mirror. 9:48pm: Just taking more—(Infuriating. I keep forgetting the ends of my sentences. Just taking more what?? I’m never going to figure out what I was trying to say. I don’t remember a bit of it. ) Anyway just took another 100mg. Hopefully that’ll be enough for the night. More¬¬—. Just happened again. More WHAT??? 9:57pm: Auditory hallucinationss. Heard my dad and my sister and my mother talking outside when there was no one there but me and my sister.. My dad asked where I was and my sister came and got me. I think. It’s already getting fuzzy. The auditory hallucinations were freaky. I was afraid my dad would notice that I’m on something. My hands feel weird. The paper on the screen feels like a hole. I’m afraid to put my hand inside. 10:08: I can’t hold onto any thoughts. It’s making recording my experiences very difficult. Heartbeat is racing. 10:10pm: It’s been a lot of fun, I’ve learned a lot, but it’s time to go to sleep as my parents are coming home soon and I’m not terribly coherent. Afterthoughts: 4:47pm Following Day: After I tried to go to sleep (It took me a long time) I had continuous hallucinations of my sister and parents coming into my room and talking to me, asking me questions. I could barely understand them and I knew that I had to reply or they would know that something was wrong. But I would just sit there silently hoping they would go away. On the few occasions that I actually tried to answer (it just came out as mumbling) they would disappear and my room would snap back into reality. Truly an intense experience. Even at a dose as low is the one I took, I highly reccomend having a sitter. This drug WILL make you both paranoid and afraid at times. It's just the nature of the drug. Having a sitter really helps to calm you down.

Experience:DPH 400mg - Barking Paper,"I decided to try diphenhydramine (Benadryl) one day, when out of marijuana. I was desperate to get high, so I grabbed a bottle of my antihistamines and went to town. On this particular day, I was chatting with friends about what I had planned to do. They decided to trip-sit me over phone. I took 400mg of DPH around noon, and within 45 minutes, I felt high. Not a good high, either. I felt incredibly anxious and paranoid throughout the rest of the day. About an hour and a half through the experience, I began to see my vision shifting in strange ways, contorting and writhing like never before. I've done magic mushrooms, but none of my experiences with that can compare to the strangeness of this warping. It was like taking a greenscreen sheet, and stretching the image, or pinching it, or someone pushing a finger up to it from the other side. Kinda like some 4th dimensional beings were trying to break into my universe. Two hours in and I read some articles and watched some videos about peoples experiences, and read about how some kid stared at a light post for 10+ seconds, which then began to wave and contort, like that of an acid trip. I decided to do the same, and picked a piece of paper on my desk. I kept losing count of the seconds and just kept restarting in my daze. After I finally made it, the paper looked like it was waving, like that of the ocean, or bugs under someones skin. I tried again, but this time was much more intense. I saw the paper turn into the shape of a dogs head, which then barked. I heard the bark as if it actually happened, and the shock of it caused me to jump. By this point, I wasn't even fully into the experience. Nothing else quite like it happened, however, and the rest of the trip was just me getting more and more tired. I told my friends about it and they sounded like they were speaking some alien language. I could barely talk, and they said I had repeated the same sentences over and over, for minutes on end afterwards.","['anxiety', 'anxious', 'auditory hallucination', 'drifting', 'focus suppression', 'language depression', 'memory suppression', 'paranoid', 'sleepiness', 'transformations']",449
Experience:Datura and nicotine smoked - 4 and ~15 hits; was actually quite pleasant,"(note: datura's oral route is much more daring. you proooooooobably shouldn't do datura orally, or probably at all. ;P) t=3:50p So, I light a cig with dried Datura innoxia flower smashed into the tip of it. I take a hit and hold for four seconds. That is all. I begin to feel an almost immediate sensation of being slightly heavier. At first, I had trip anxiety, which quickly faded. t=3:54p Second hit, my visual acuity seems slightly impaired up close. I got a hit of nicotine from it too. t=3:57p Connecting my words seems very slightly difficult. No hallucinations, which I am glad of. Occasional and very small areas of warmth come onto my body. t=3:59p I seem very slightly more calm, at least compared to the beginning. t=4:00p I tell my offline friend I smoked Datura. lol. t=4:01p I feel things to be slightly more humorous! This seems great so far! I get these pleasant feelings of warmth more often, like I just wanna go to bed. This is fucking awesome.... <3 t=4:03p Pulse (radial, two fingers) is actually slower than usual. At threshold smoked doses, could this be an anxiolytic? My feet feel warm. I test my heaviness again; I do feel slightly heavy as I walk to the kitchen and back to get my cappuccino. I'm not gonna smoke anymore. I had a headache before this, probably from high blood pressure... :( Now, it's very imperceivable. :D t=4:11p Another Datura smoked hit taken. t=4:13p Another one. I take a few extra hits of the cig. t=4:18p Moderate sedated feeling noted. I try to pack a bit of dried Datura into the cigarette, so I just tear the middle of it open and pack ""bud"" in. t=4:26p I call it a success. I feel like I could nod off, but also awake...I feel...happy. :) Datura isn't all that bad smoked, I guess. I test my heaviness. Oh yeah. I feel heavier. Not overwhelming, like my ~800 mg DPH trip, but it's noticeable. .. :) I liked this experience. I'd recommend Datura/nicotine to others. Just take out some of the tobacco at the start, pack in some dried Datura flower, and you'll get a pretty pleasant high. May give you a little anxiety, so just use 0.5 mg of lorazepam (my boo~ <3) or a low (~30 mg) DXM dose. Watch out for DXM interactions. Ahhh.. This is so good. :) Byeeeeeeeeeee.","['anxiety suppression', 'compulsive redosing', 'decreased heart rate', 'increased sense of humor', 'perception of increased weight', 'sedation', 'spontaneous bodily sensations']",638
Experience:Datura Alcoholic Tincture,"(All times are in hours:minutes) T–00:15 Dizziness, slight nausea, what you would normally experience on the come-up from alcohol intoxication. T–00:30 Feeling increased dizziness, not much else. T–00:45 I am experiencing slight dryness of the throat, eyes, nasal passages, and mucous membranes. These are to be expected from deliriant substances. T–01:15 The dryness of mucous membranes is increasing in intensity now. This intense dryness is probably due to the alcohol’s drying effects compounding with the tropane alkaloids. T–01:35 I am experiencing greatly increased nausea, as well as some minor feelings of increased gravity. Again, this is to be expected from tropane alkaloids. T–01:53 I am stricken with a vague feeling of paranoia. This is most likely from the anxiety-inducing effects of the datura tropanes interacting with the depressant effects of the ethanol. Of course, I am not particularly bothered by the “feelings of impending doom” because of my previous experience with deliriant recreational substances, but it is greatly increased more than usual, perhaps as a result of the alcohol’s serotonin-affecting effects. T–02:25 I am experiencing slight auditory hallucinations, voices and such. However, these are unusual as unlike voices normally heard on deliriants alone, the voices are understandable and make some semblance of sense. Of course, this is probably due to the alcohol decreasing the amount of activity in my neurological organ, which is the cause of the commonly reported effect of “thinking fewer thoughts, but what thoughts you do think are clearer”. The voices seem to be speaking phrases that make logical sense; subjects like asking for names, favourite things, and other trivial questions. T–03:12 I am now experiencing slight distortions, mostly laggy vision, akin to so-called “lag” on internet games, e.g. looking at flowing wood grain, but the grain keeps irregularly jumping between reversing, stopping, and flowing. T–04:45 I am experiencing intense diplopia, exacerbated by extreme blurred vision. T–05:39 I am starting to come down. Auditory hallucinationss are gone, and I am experiencing intense painful nausea, likely from gastric disturbances caused by the ethanol. I will lie down on the bed. T–06:32 The gastric disturbances have subsided. I still have blurred vision on close objects, but diplopia is gone. My throat etc. is still dry, but starting to regain moisture little by little. T–08:45 I am experiencing an intense headache and hangover. I’ve taken some aspirin and will take a nap. T–09:51 I seem to be feeling a bit more normal, but still have a dull ache in my forehead. I drink two glasses of water with a multivitamin and some choline tablets. T–10:18 I am feeling much better. I feel this is enough to conclude this report. Conclusion: This concludes my report on the effects of the alcoholic beverage made from fermented datura cuttings with an unknown ratio of alcohol to tropanes. I will definitely have to find a way to decrease the amount of tropane alkaloids present in the final concoction.

Experience:Results of Experiment by Isopropanol,"Testing: First Phase Objective: Attempt to engage in romantic and/or sexual contact with a sic dicitur “Shadow Person” (for science!). For this test, a female or similar entity would be preferred. Substance(s) Utilised: Exactly 500 mg of Diphenhydramine in the form of pink, minuscule pills consisting of 25 mg each. Tea of one and one-half (1½) leaves obtained from a mature Datura Wrightii specimen steeped for approximately thirty-five (35) minutes. Substance(s) on Stand-By (pro re nata): +4 mg physostigmine in two sterile syringes consisting of 2 mg each (one is to be for emergency use if needed, the other to be used as a back-up and/or as an additional supplementary dose) to be administered by intramuscular injection. One (1) container of eighty caffeine tablets, consisting of 200 mg each. One (1) container of sixty citicoline caplets, consisting of 500 mg each. One (1) container of sixty L-carnitine tablets, consisting of 500 mg each. One (1) container of thirty clonidine tablets, consisting of 0.2 mg each. Further Information: Carried out in dark room, no light or electricity. Doors and windows locked. Anything sharp or dangerous removed. Assistant has hand-held battery-powered illumination device and journal with two black ink fountain pens. Assistant was given strict instructions not to interfere unless absolutely necessary, to paraphrase my condition and/or actions during my experiment into said journal, and to administer the antidote and/or required medicines if an emergency should occur. Time and Duration of Trip: Ingestion – 11:30pm Onset – 12:00am Rise – 12:45am Peak – 2:30am Fall – 5:35am Veisalgia – 6:00am to 1:53pm Conclusory Outcome(s): Successful. Completion of Objective(s): Successful. Further Note(s): Throughout this experiment report, the hallucinated entity will be referred to as SE (Shadow Entity). This experiment report will be in the first person unless otherwise specified in the report. This experiment report is not in direct chronological order. The individual statements should not be assumed to be in an explicitly sequential order. However, the report as a whole is in a relatively chronological order to an appropriate extent. This experiment report contains extremely explicit material. Preface – Rise: Ingestion of prepared tea and pills commenced. Experiencing slight, but barely-noticeable pseudo-hallucinations e.g. morphing, flowing, distortions, etc. After one to two hours, I notice the distortions gradually escalating in intensity. After another minimally relevant chronological period, nonpermanent, substance-induced schizophrenia symptoms appear. Objects in central vision freely form and eventually morph into gestalt forms lacking borders, appearance deemed to be of a cascading pattern of ergativity. It gradually advances to actual hallucinations, both auditory and optical. This was when I initiated attempts to cause a shadow entity to manifest. I successfully created the manifestation of an SE of quasi-feminine form. I will now move on to the experiment. Objective: Engage in romantic and/or sexual contact with SE. At first, SE is not responsive to communication, including commands. After approximately five minutes, SE starts to respond to simple questions, and its ability to reply improves over time. It eventually is able to hold a basic conversation and accept basic commands. This inclination of behavior akin to higher cognitive functioning is particularly intriguing and warrants greater research at a future time. The subject has features typically appropriate for the average human female: somewhat long hair, average mammary size, visible genitals equivalent to a vagina, etc. The subject does not wear any clothing and seems a relatively opaque dark grayish color with a minuscule amount of transparency. Experiment: Willingness to follow commands. “C” will represent commands and “R” will represent responses. C: “Walk from the North side of the room towards the South side.” R: SE proceeds to travel from one side of the room to the opposing side. C: “Walk from the South side of the room towards the North side and end at NNW.” R: SE proceeds to travel from standing position on the South side to the North side while curving appropriately to arrive towards the North-North-West orientation. (I now proceed to unfasten my pants and undergarments. In colloquial terms, I “whipped my dick out.”) C: “Walk towards me until you are about two feet away and stand.” R: SE walks in my direction and stops approximately 1 foot in front of me, with its front torso facing towards me. C: “Very satisfactory. Now, stay absolutely motionless, so I may test your corporeality.” R: SE does not give affirmation by speech or expression. It obeys command and remains stationary. (I now kneel down on one knee, and with my index finger and middle finger I attempt to manually penetrate its orifice resembling with near perfection a vaginal opening, sans vulva. My fingers penetrate, and I am able to feel vaginal walls, the tactile sensation resembling wet skin. SE makes a vaguely sexual noise upon stimulation. I then remove my fingers and attempt to perform cunnilingus on the subject. There is no taste, and it does not seem to produce any lubricant juices, and no actual lubricants have been used, but still it feels as though it was lubricated. Upon entrance of my tongue, it makes a much more sexual noise than before and proceeds to lay its hand upon my shoulder as if to encourage me to continue. I do not oblige. I then proceed to remove my tongue from its orifice and stand up. Next, I begin phase two of testing.) C: “Now, kneel on your knees and grasp my phallus.” R: SE complies. It then proceeds to look up at me, as if it were attempting to act seductive or sultry. C: “Very good. Next, proceed to move your hands up and down my penile shaft.” R: SE hesitates, and then complies. (I can feel stimulation as if it were actually real. Strangely, however, at the same time, there appears to be little if any, friction. Remember that I have not used any form of lubrication.) C: “Now, proceed to perform fellatio.” R: SE complies. (The sensation is practically otherworldly. Its oral cavity is somewhat luke-warm and wet, but again, no actual saliva or lube is left on my penis. I proceed to ejaculate. However, my seminal fluid appears to go through SE as if it suddenly became ethereal but without any actual change relative to the rest of our bodies. I now start phase three.) C: “Now, move over onto the bed and lie down flat with your front torso pointed at the ceiling.” R: SE attempts to ambulate towards the bed sultrily, and proceeds to lie down as requested. It then appears to fondle its bosom while allowing its free hand to rub up and down its leg. (I proceed to go to bed and position myself over it. I attempt ‘french kissing’ with SE. It succeeds the same feeling of non-existent salivary lubrication like mentioned before. SE appears to be deriving some enjoyment from this experience. It sometimes becomes tough to remind me that it is not an actual human.) At this point, I black out For the rest of this experiment report, I will have to work by what my assistant had recorded. My assistant apparently seems like he would be very great authoring ‘adult’ books, judging from the verbose and romantic descriptions. However, for your sake, I will attempt to water it down as much as possible. You’re greatly welcome. (I succeed in vaginal intercourse with SE. Coitus stayed strictly in the missionary position. According to my assistant, all that he saw was me violently dry humping the bed while grasping the pillows. After perceived ejaculation [and of course, the semen went onto the bedding] my assistant informed me that I then rolled over facing the ceiling and proceeded to light an imagined cigarette.

Experience: 450 Datura seeds - Talking to Ghosts,"I will try to recall the experience as best as I can, but it was incredibly powerful. I only wish words did it justice. There was so much more than can possibly be said here. This was amazing, horrible, scary, fascinating, annoying, uncomfortable, painful and surreal, all at once. This happened a few years ago (it is now Jan-2015), but I believe it is worth mentioning. I had been discouraged from recording the experience at the time by the fact that all the careful notes I had been taking during the experience turned out to be nothing but illegible scribbles, symbols and crumpled notebook paper when I examined them the next day. I had previously been given 150 seeds by a friend who mistook them for Morning Glory Seeds. This mistake could have been dangerous, but in the end I was shown the plant and properly identified it. I chose to take some seed pods home with me. With a little bit of research online, and with the seeds themselves, I ended up finding what I believed to be a dose that would take me far, but wouldn't put me in the hospital, or worse. Daturas potency varies 5:1, so I now always start with a very very low dose, and work up. Preparation: I prepared 450 individually counted and finely ground seeds into a coffee filter and tied a string around it so it resembled a closed tea bag. I dipped it in a pot of warm water for approximately 24 hours, and agitated it every few hours. I discarded the seed bag, and I took the potion as the sun fell, under the moon. This seemed appropriate because this plant had earned the nickname ""Moon Flower"". My brother came up for the weekend, and wanted to try the experiment with me in the last minute. He was to be my sitter anyway, so I gave the okay. My brother was not made tea, but instead yogurt, so we could get on with the experience. For my brother I prepared 150 finely ground seeds, and sprinkled them into a yogurt mix. I had been fasting all day for the experiment. I do not know what he had to eat, but he weighed around 135 at the time, I believe. It might have been better for him to start at 50-100, but I gave him 150 because he insisted he wanted to ""really feel it"". Experience: I began feeling the effects of this potion before I was done drinking it. Granted, it took me about 15 minutes to finish because it tasted so foul, but most potions for the mind taste bad, I find; Its almost a right of passage in my eyes. Still, this kicked in notably fast when compared to my other Datura experiences. My brother had a much easier time downing his yogurt mix. I find, even with a scientific and rational mind, I enjoy the ritualistic aspect of these experiences, so I tried to be as serious about it as I could. This was an exploration of the mind, not recreational intoxication. About 15-20 Minutes after downing the potion I was already feeling very ""drunk"" and distended from my body. I hadn't even stood up from my original seat; I was just battling nausea. I had been fighting an incredible urge to purge since the first sip, and considering the sheer intensity of the confusion I was facing, I was abandoning the idea that I was going to peacefully meditate myself into another plane of thought... I didn't even make it to the bathroom. I purged right back into the pot I had prepared my brew in (before I even got a chance to stand up). I might be paranoid, but I think this may have saved my life. I faded out of memorable consciousness after stumbling to the bathroom. ... Time doesn't make any sense. The notes I am writing don't seem to want to form together coherently . Im very confused... and uncomfortable. My stomach doesn't hurt anymore, which makes it much easier to think clearly… but I still feel very ""drunk"" and my skin feels incredibly... sharp? Im shaking, and I don't know why. It hurts to touch anything that's not completely smooth or soft. Touching anything with my hands or arms sends sharp pins and lighting bolts up my nerves. I think my throat is swelling up, and I am compulsively drinking water to ensure it doesn't close.. I am swallowing nothing constantly, just to ensure I can still swallow… trying to breath through my nose is easier. My throat might just be numb, and not swollen, but I cant tell... I fade out again… I wake up sitting in the dark, apologizing to my blanket for being so intoxicated. I don't know how I got here. I am more self aware now, but cannot think clearly, as I seem to genuinely think my blanket is my ex-girlfriend, who had deflated into a pile of self aware skin and muscle, due to the disappointment she felt; she had always disapproved of my studies, and claimed I was always just trying to ""get high"" …She lays there, crumpled on my bed and starring at me disapprovingly with a morose look on her face... I hold her for a while, and apologize more… I fade out… I decided to try and take a shower. I believe this was irresponsible and dangerous. It should have been obvious to me because the room was spinning, and I found it very difficult to walk (or function at all, for that matter). My legs just give out underneath me, and I fall in the hallway... over, and over.. Stumbling to find my placement, I fade out on my knees, staring at the carpet... This fade seemed to happen quite a bit. I was slipping in and out of consciousness. With Datura, I still seem to function while Im out, as opposed to the more familiar nod associated with opiates. With an opiate I wake up right where I faded out, but with Datura, I wake up in a room I don't remember walking into, in the middle of doing things, or talking to people in contexts that dont' make any sense. Similar to a drunken psychosis. ... I woke up in mid sentence, realizing I was talking to no one, but aware I had been talking for at least 5 minutes prior. I wonder who I must have been talking to... could it have been my brother? I then realize I am naked, shortly after that I realize Im in the shower with water running down my face. I had been talking to no one.. this was very interesting to me… I wonder what could have possibly caused me to slip in and out of ""worlds"" like this, with no real recollection of what I had been doing prior, or at least why I was doing it. I fade out again, and wake up standing in the hall, with a sober brother of mine (3rd brother) asking me a question. I don't remember what I said, or what the question was, but he told me (the next day) that I had answered him coherently, even though the answer had nothing at all to do with the question. While I was in the shower the brother that had joined me on my adventure had woken my grandmother out of her sleep (it was about 2 in the morning) to inform her the ""flower truck"" was outside. Again, we live in the middle of nowhere. No flower truck, no neighbors, and It's not even daytime. I don't believe he saw a flower truck, but I do think he genuinely believed it was there when he told her. I wake up, again, in mid sentence. I am am in my room, and having a conversation with some Cat-in-the-hat slippers that I have apparently placed on my bed, so the faces faced me. I guess so they could pay attention... I reached over to use my laptop to play some music, and nothing was there... I didn't have a laptop…. Why did I think one was there? I am still confused, my skin still tingles painfully, and my throat is still sore and closed at this point. This fade in- fade out, theme happened many many more times, and every time I woke up talking to an inanimate object or someone that wasn't there. Sometimes still genuinely believing the clock could understand what I was saying. This was a very mind oriented experience, not classically psychedelic at all. The visuals are light but unique. Jagged changes in my environment take place throughout the trip (when the room isn't spinning). Corners and walls bend, and shake quickly then go back to normal, like something out of a horror movie. When the director flashes something weird on the screen for a few frames, and it goes away as fast as it arrived, is the closest thing I can compare it to (parts of a chair shaking against its own structure, in a way that should break it, but doesn't, for example). Probably… an even better analogy would be to compare it to fast glitching in a 3-d video game model. Ive seen nothing like it in other entheogens. I finally have to give in to the drowsiness that has been chasing me the entire night. I go to bed shaking because I feel cold, but I wasn't. Everything I touch still feels like razors cutting into my skin, and I will continue drinking water every 3 minutes through out the night, while I am awake. I hear, while trying to lay in bed, auditory hallucinations that sound ominous and far away. Nothing to understand really… it seems like old trees moaning and whining in the distance, maybe as a way of communicating to eachother. ""The language of the trees"" I think, and I slip off to sleep easily enough. I wake up with a ""hangover"" the next day. I would never do this again, for many reasons. Im glad, however, that I was able to experience it. I wish I could remember more of it. Even reading this wall of text, it doesn't seem to properly convey to you the experience... the weird almond taste in my mouth, the strange noises and thoughts that didn't seem to be my own, etc. Hours of adventure condensed into a few short paragraphs. I believe this was an irresponsible dose, and I had not understood the dangers of going so far in. I might just be paranoid, but I didn't know the seeds could be as toxic as they can be during the time of ingestion, or I would not have gone in do deep; it was poor research on my part. I would recommend the experience itself, but I ultimately would never recommend the dosage I took. With responsibility and caution it can be quite the experience, but I wouldn't expect it to be fun.

Experience:Amanita muscaria 6cm diamter dried cap smoked,"Two days ago we went to the nearby forest to look some mushrooms and i was in shock when we found 1,7 kg fresh Fly-Agaric mushrooms. Dried them in a mushroom drying device and left in a jar wrapped in newspaper. Today i did some research how to prepare the mushroom. One of the ways to ingest them is to simply smoke the skin of the mushroom. I took one of the dried caps about 6 cm in diameter. Scraped the gills from the cap with a toothpick (was super easy)and grinded it in a grinder with some tobacco and rolled a spliff. Smoked it on the balcony wondering what will happen. The smoke felt surprisingly mild and smelled and tasted like roasted nuts. I could feel the effects during smoking already, I finished the spliff and went back to my room. I'm feeling a mild warm buzz right now. Music sounds great and there is a nice mild euphoric body high present aswell. Getting chills right now, while writing this report. I'm salivating as hell and if i touch my wounds on my hands the pain is somewhat suppressed. On closed eyes there's something going on. Its not the usual visual noise we can see everyday sober but there's not much in it. Don't really think anything more will happen but I am totally enjoying myself. Next time ill test the effects after smoking a larger quantity. There is potential in the shroom and can tell this tiny forest fellow i tried today is a great mood enhancer.

The visual effects were colorful, started as closed eye only, and ended with both closed and open eye visuals. Circles were the main visual theme of the experience, as I did more the points from which they originiated increased in an incredibly geometric and mathematical way.

Experience:200 mg of MXP + N2O:20 chargers,"I was in my home. My experience began at about 10 pm. There was a fairly violent thunderstorm taking place outside and I was engaged in light conversation with my housemates. Everybody seemed to be getting sleepy and I could feel a wanderlust building in my mind. A quiet house and a raging storm struck me as a perfect backdrop for a night of deep introspection. I excused myself to the bathroom with the pretense of needing to defecate, and administered an IM injection of 100 mg of MXP. I sat down on the toilet and waited for the effects to begin. Within five minutes I heard a noise that was difficult to describe, but was somewhat similar to a sustained cricket chirp. I held my hands out in front of me. Visually they looked unchanged, but cognitively they felt smaller and denser. I began to notice that the colors of the scenery around me were getting less and less saturated. Hues of sepia, sap green, orange-red and lemon yellow seemed to dominate. When focusing on more detailed images, it became somewhat difficult to keep them from blurring and jumbling together. My whole body seemed to be buzzing with a peculiar and prickly numbness that was most pronounced in my hands, my lower legs and the back of my neck. This feeling was intense and a little painful, but was in no way unwelcome or unpleasant. Standing up, I flushed the toilet and began to wash my hands. I knew in my mind that the water was hot, but my skin did not register this feeling. Thoughts were now coming and going very quickly. I began to consider myself a film director of sorts, only the film in question was my real-life experience. I found this notion to be very exciting, and as I exited the bathroom, a sense of energetic calm pervaded my movements. I returned to my room where the others were still seated. I offered up some whip-it cartridges I had purchased earlier that week. The conversation continued. One friend was laughing rather hysterically and drooling from the N2O. That's why they call it laughing gas, I remarked. I took the empty canister and released two more chargers inside. Through circular breathing, I inhaled all of the gas in the chamber. Little specks of dark black spread across my visual field, much like a television with a weak signal. I could sense that my mind was losing touch with its ability to sense any stimuli around me. In my mouth was a strange, synthetic taste and I could not tell if my eyelids were open or closed. I was struck by the juxtaposition of the very naturally introspective thought patterns repeating in my conscious brain, and the industrially produced chemicals that helped me get there. I thought of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and the beauty inherent in the cold and jagged city-scape that is the back drop for the film. The effects of the N2O dissipated almost as quickly as they began. We're probably gonna go to bed. Right on, I said. I started to collect all of my effects as my housemates retreated to their respective chambers. After pacing for a few moments, I decided to sit down in my chair, just to collect myself. I was having a very difficult time determining the actual decibel level of the sounds going on around me, and I was nervous about disturbing any of the freshly sleeping bodies in the house. This consideration, along with my directive to collect all of the physical objects I would need with me caused a jumble in my mind. In that moment, it felt as though the process of ironing out all of these details and making it downstairs was taking me a great deal of time. A look at the clock after I was safely situated on the first floor couch said otherwise. On the coffee table by my side rested my box of whip-its, my canister, 100 mg of MXP, a glass jar for mixing, a sterile 25 gage IM syringe, and some filters. I also had a set of headphones. I considered all of the items before me and tried to piece together some type of order of operations for myself. New thoughts were upon me very quickly and I found myself repeating certain phrases over and over again. -Ever, never. Ever, never. Ever, never... -Wherever you go, there you are. Wherever you go, there you are... My conscious mind struck me as merely a curious spectator to the real-world actions of my body. I knew that I had made a decision to prepare the solution, filter and inject it, but the whole process had a dream-like quality to it. I could not get out of my head the notion that I was some kind of film actor in a hard-boiled noir drama of yesteryear. The second injection came on with force as I lay down on the couch and wrapped my body in a large duvet (not that I had any sense of the actual temperature in the room). I had the lights turned down very low, and a blink or a double take would often cause the colors around me to recede completely into grayscale. I put on my headphones and searched the internet for an old radio broadcast to which I might listen quietly. I landed on a 1939 Camel Caravan special starring Benny Goodman. The crackle in the recording and the cadence of the MC's voice pleased me immensely. I especially liked hearing him deliver his required lines from the Camel advertising office. Choosy smokers choose Camel cigarettes. Made from the finest Turkish and domestic tobaccos... I began charging up my N2O canister once more. Inhaling the gas, I could feel my thoughts reaching escape velocity. My body seemed to be fusing with the duvet as my visual field was replaced completely by what seemed to be a great big, two-dimensional sheet of interlocking geometric shapes. It resembled the skin of a small reptile but was colored a muted orange. All the other instruments faded from earshot and I could now only make out Benny Goodman's clarinet solo. I thought of some friends and family with whom I wished I would communicate more often. I thought of their lives as they understood them. I felt myself losing a grip on my own ego as I attempted to deeply empathize with other people who think and act somewhat, or even wholly differently than I do. I remembered studying in class the person-centered therapy of Carl Rogers, and I hoped that all of these racing thoughts would instill in me a stronger capability to empathize with others. Over the next half hour, I repeated my circular breathing process with the N2O about ten more times. I felt so connected with the music in my ears, and so connected with the people I am privileged enough to call friends. As I returned upstairs to my bed, I felt very at ease with myself. I knew that I would be very exhausted the following day at work, but I could sense in myself feelings of pride and loving kindness that trumped that bit of information. It took a little while to fall asleep, but my positivity persisted through that night and into the next day.

Experience:100 mg- Actually Lifechanging,"After spending years thinking very fondly of DXM, I decided it was time to try another dissociative. I managed to order MXP and spent several hours finding a sweet spot via the Shulgin Method of starting very small and increasing dosage. By the time I reached approximately 75 mgs, I found myself feeling quite nice. My body felt warm and dry, and clean. I had expected something like DXM, but DXM has a much more liquid feel, oozy, whereas MXP felt like cloth. I recall feeling incredibly reckless, acting as strangely as I liked in front of my parents, which provoked them to ask what are you on, as they will. I told them nothing at all and fled to the basement. In the basement, I insufflated I would say 25 more mgs, and put on some music. It was music that I'd never heard before, just something I found on the 420chan dissociative discussion, a man playing guitar. I remember the music not only sounded incredible but felt very good to listen to, nearly orgasmic, in fact I was moaning out loud which provoked my dad to come down and investigate. Normally, I would be much much more cautious, but I'd like to stress that even at a low dose, the sort of dissociation that MXP provides you with may delete all worry/anxiety to a level that is actually dangerous. By the time my dad came downstairs, I was attempting to insufflate more and raise the dose, but was unable to, as he had removed the door from my bedroom earlier that week and therefore I had no privacy. He called the police and what followed is a gigantic debacle involving the police, the hospital (why?) and later the mental hospital but that's all ancient history. During this debacle however, I remember a growing warmth in my head, around the temples, and a wonderful sense of peace. I told the police officer, I feel GREAT, and actually tried to discuss the effects with him, which he had no interest in doing. Normally I have severe social anxiety, but I was able to do both this, and later on I recall telling the two nurses how pretty I thought their eyes were, and then comparing and contrasting their two pairs of eyes for them. I should note that even at this low dose there are spaces which I can't quite remember, or can't remember the order of, but this could also be attributed to DXM use earlier in the week. Also, at a certain point, I'm not sure where it falls on the timeline, I completely exploded, not physically exploded, MXP isn't that dangerous, but emotionally, yelling and screaming in a way that I'm intensely embarrassed about now, like a spoiled little girl. I would recommend MXP only for an environment void of high suspicions. In low doses, take it with a group of friends who know you are taking a drug. It would probably be very nice in combination with alcohol. I would personally like to combine it with cannabis to negate the anxiety and embarrassment cannabis usually lays on me. In high doses, because it's a dissociative, I'd recommend taking it in either an absolutely safe place in which you're virtually locked away, alone or with only one or two friends.

Experience:Ketamine (unknown dosage) - States of unity and interconnectedness,"With regards to ""feeling one with the universe"" I have had this experience once or twice with 2+ tabs of LSD, but interestingly, I feel this most deeply when I am under the influence of ketamine. I certainly feel the dissociation from one's self and indeed reality, however the 'place' I think 'I' go is the universe. When I am well and truly over the line I feel as if I and the universe are equal and anything I 'feel' or perceive is just a manifestation of the universe. When I use the word universe I may simply be talking about the room I'm in; I often feel connected to all the inanimate objects, sounds and smells in my environment.

Experience: 500 mg Ketamine (Insufflated) - A Nauseating Voyage Through Parallel Universes,"Ketamine grounding paper In the beginning, I was starting to feel numb in my whole body. Tactile sensations were largely dulled, except for the sensation of the wetness of my insufflation straw. My nose was running and I was gently blowing my nose. I was trying not to blow out any of the ketamine, but I had to do something, because otherwise I couldn't have continued snorting it. For the final two lines, I had trouble lining up the straw with the lines. My depth perception was nil, so it was quite difficult to insufflate them. Eventually I finished all the ketamine though. Sometime during the insufflation I put a red little cough sweet in my mouth in an attempt to mitigate the horrible, repulsive taste of ketamine. I spit it out on my desk though because I was paranoid and didn't want to risk choking on anything. At some point I tossed it in the trash can. At one point during the trip, I heard this ""divine"" voice. I'm calling it divine because it sounded really reverberated and as if it were coming from every direction. In reality, it was actually my little sister standing outside my locked door asking if I would like to have my dinner now. I somehow managed to answer ""no,"" and continued to trip balls. Throughout the experience I heard my family eating in the kitchen, the silverware clanging against the porcelain, their indistinct chattering and my mother laughing. At one point I was getting out of my chair, getting into bed, and tucking myself in. It felt like the way my body was moving was predetermined and completely out of my control. It was like the subconscious motions that I carried out every night when going to bed were laid out in front of me and shown systematically. The movements also felt strangely mechanical, as in they felt very exaggerated and precise. After a while I must've gotten out of bed and back into my chair. These movements were also experienced in the same way, including me trying to make my bed. I had written this message on a piece of paper as a way to ground myself. This was a very good idea. The paper had the time of ingestion on it. I was wearing my watch, so I could compare the time on my watch with the time on the paper and approximate how much time had passed. The whole thing lasted a lot longer than I expected. It was difficult reading the sign at times, I had to close one of my eyes and focus hard to read it. So, another thing I did to try grounding myself was to adjust the arm rests of my chair. Doing this wasn't easy because it felt like my limbs had fallen asleep. Sadly, I didn't experience any holes, spaces, voids, or structures, which is really what I wanted out of the experience (visual disconnection). I did, however, experience this nauseating effect of having the real world (the version with the grounding paper) receding away from me. It felt like I was being transported between different parallel universes. These universes were all more or less the same. I was always being brought to my room, with my family eating in the kitchen. It was the exact same time. Something set them apart though, I could tell I wasn't home. It felt like I was being brought to different places each time. I wasn't allowed to stay in one place for very long though. I was losing my grasp of myself more and more with all the traveling. Eventually I think my sense of self completely dissolved. Around 30 minutes in I must have managed to gain enough control of my body to grab the computer mouse and pause the music I was listening to. It was paused at 25:57. I also remember pressing the button which rolls up my blinds, and this was evident after the experience because the button was attached to a boom arm which I had accidentally moved when pressing it. At around 45 minutes in I was salivating and throwing up into my trash can. This marked the beginning of the comedown. After 1 hour I started to feel very grounded, my head was a lot clearer, and I was certain that this was the end of the experience, that I was returning home. I was left lethargic and exhausted afterwards, it took me over an hour to get up from my chair. In the afterglow, I was experiencing immense, unfortunately short-lived, gratitude for things that I normally deemed inconvenient, such as being alive, having the family I have, and living at home. Walking around the house felt really weird. It felt like my body was made of cotton, but my feet were made out of bricks.

So, I pinch offf around 50mg more and parachute. T+3:00 As mentioned, the purpose of this trip is to work on my social anxiety and depression. But because the nearest clinic that does legal ketamine-IV depression treatment would require me to fly there and back again 10x in ten weeks, thats out of my price range. The previous day, somewhat bolstered by a small dose of flubromazolam, I contacted a bunch of old friends and actually got invited to a party, but got zonked out and couldnt go. Thats not gonna stop me now, though. I want to socialize, go to a bar, even though its Sunday and most bars are closed I find a dive car and take a cab there. They even serve me a beer even though Im way beyond fucked. T+3:30 This is went I did what you SHOULD never do. I poured the rest of the 1g baggie of ephenidine (minus spillage) in a cup of water and swallowed it. I had now consumed 800-900mg of ephenidine i a four-hour time span. I also added a few drops of f-lam to the mix. Later found the bottle empty, but suspect most of it was spilled or thrown in the the drain. The next three days are a blur. I mostly bedridden, completely delirious. Eventually wake up to my parents in my apartment (they have an emergency key, mostly in case I lose mine, over overdose on drugs apparently.)","['abnormal heartbeat', 'analysis enhancement', 'appetite suppression', 'changes in gravity', 'ego replacement', 'internal hallucination', 'motor control loss', 'mouth numbing', 'perception of decreased weight', 'personal bias suppression', 'sedation', 'spontaneous tactile sensations', 'stimulation', 'temperature regulation suppression', 'time distortion']",1082
Experience:Ephenidine:185mg - A Weird and Rewarding Trip,"This trip was a weird one - I have one previous experience with ephenidine and the timeline of the trip was vastly different. The come up time previously was as short at 15 minutes, while the full come up took approximately one hour according to my notes. There was an initial dosage difference, and I started out this trip wanting to test 80mg as a ""common"" but not ""heavy"" dose. I would say that my experience puts 80mg solidly into the ""common dose"" range for an oral ROA. The abnormal come up times may suggest a non-linear dosing curve for this substance, which I find interesting. I was not satisfied by the effects of 80mg, even though marijuana intensified the effects. I decided to re-dose approximately 100mg to have a fully immersive experience and was granted one. While listening to music, I would have mini hole experiences. They were incredibly easy to direct from within the mind and were visual and tactile in nature. The sound was transformed into physical feelings in a beautiful flow of stimuli. This substance is stimulating at lower doses and becomes more physically dissociating at higher doses. Marijuana intake greatly increased closed eye visuals and perspective shifts, including out of body experiences. The stimulating nature of the substance lingers after the psychological effects. These are notes taken during the experience: 11:11am - dosed 80mg. 12:27pm - feeling the full come up, this come up took a lot longer than previous experience. feelings of tingly body, mild waves of euphoria. coordination isn't impaired. heart rate increase. spontaneous bodily sensations. 12:31pm - Effects present even more, stimulation, double vision. 1:15pm - weed has intensified the effects. increased music appreciation. physical euphoria. the headspace is a bit disorganized, mild paranoia is present probably from the weed. consumed a lot of cannabis. stimulation 1:20pm - The stimulation is very present, i am motivated to do things and go outside. 1:51pm - Very stimulating and motivating, i cleaned my room. I am introspective and thinking about personal problems while getting stuff done. I am able to function on autopilot. this dose is much more manageable than the higher dose, which felt more sedating. double vision is still present along with increased heart rate. 2:19pm - Time dilation is present, this is stimulating. 2:24pm - Music appreciation, the physical euphoria is present with the changes in the music. Easy to close eyes and lose yourself in the music. 4:49pm - Still feeling stimulated but headspace is back to normal, redose 50mg. 5:40pm - Redose 54mg. 7:06pm - Smoked some bowls, stimulation is present, anesthesia isnt. super stimmy, increased heart rate, increased focus, Motivation enhancement. 7:55pm - Very dissod and stimmed, teeth grinding, increased heart rate. 8:22pm- Had hole experience. 8:33pm - Time dilation, motor control loss, increased heart rate, holing is present, CEVs, tracers, sound -->physical feelings and music appreciation. 11:06pm - Spent that time watching planet earth, was super cool, tracers present, heart rate still up. dosing on etizolam to come down.","['double vision', 'focus enhancement', 'holes', 'increased heart rate', 'increased music appreciation', 'internal hallucination', 'motivation enhancement', 'motor control loss', 'physical euphoria', 'spaces and voids', 'spontaneous physical sensations', 'stimulation', 'teeth grinding', 'time distortion', 'tracers', 'visual disconnection']",704
Experience:1064mgs - Fascinating DXM experience - Unusual effects,"My friend and I decided to try a 4th plateau trip on DXM together. 1062mgs DXM (3 bottles of Robitussin), 50mgs DPH (attempt to counteract nausea, not to co-trip), 1-gallon white grapefruit juice and a single plain bagel each for the 20hrs before. My prior experience with psychedelics/dissociatives included only an earlier 3rd plateau trip a few weeks before, salvia, and borderline-psychedelic doses of weed (to the point of geometry); before you say it, I know, I was definitely a little too courageous. My friend had done everything you can name at least once, and at one point a few years back was using lower doses of DXM frequently, but never 3rd/4th plateau, and hadn't touched it since. I'll skip the uninteresting parts that you could get from any DXM trip report, like projectile vomiting syrup and the expected dissociation, and I'll get to the goods. Perhaps from lack of tolerance, my body had a very bad reaction to the stuff and I couldn't really enjoy the trip's peak. My mind would spend some time in a hallucinatory place (usually a static image of an inexplicable object, or a color field, or nothingness) before getting ripped back to reality by heavy breathing or my heart beating too fast, or perhaps another bout of nausea. At one point our friend stepped in (not knowing what we were up to) and he reported afterward that I seemed like I was in intense physical/mental distress. That's all nothing very unusual; pretty much what you'd expect of a bad DXM trip. However, my experience had some worthwhile moments. Later in the day, after I made it back to my place (aided by a sober friend) I was lounging around waiting for the trip to subside enough for me to get some sleep. Perhaps from the white grapefruit juice, I entered a state I can only describe as ""semi-sigma."" All the sigma effects were there, but only to a moderate extent, and I was still cognitively lucid, ie aware that delusions were caused by a trip and generally able to figure out what was real and what wasn't. I even had the notorious ""wacky-cam,"" where closing my eyes would show me whatever scene I was looking at before but with dreamlike delusional additions, all completely nonsensical. And the most fantastic effect of all, something I've never heard anyone report from a trip besides a few DXM/DPH accounts: staring at the ceiling, the textured bumps would start to move and rearrange and swirl in patterns. But it wouldn't stop there! The swirling patterns would start to come out of the ceiling and form three-dimensional objects coming out at me, all made still of the same textured dots, like this but without the wires between the dots. I remember a formless beautiful fractal spiral coming out at me, a dragonfly forming from these dots and coming down at me, and a flower, all very clearly. I could reset the condensation of these objects by double-taking. It was very beautiful and helped me calm down after the incredibly unpleasant height of the trip. Even more fascinating than that was my friend's experience. We haven't had a chance to talk for too long, but he says that at the peak of the trip his consciousness was off in some alien world with light beings who lived according to their own physics. This is actually semi-common with 4th plateau DXM dosages, if I understand correctly. He said it was hard to remember much of the experience and much of what the beings had to say to him, but that it was very pleasant and that he felt welcomed into this strange world. Incredibly, when the aforementioned friend stepped into the room and tried to talk to my fellow tripper, he responded ""(friend's name) is not here right now, but he's okay,"" or so our unexpected visitor reports. My friend says that he did not actively perceive, see, or otherwise experience this interaction, but while he was in dissociative-headspace-land he for a moment felt the presence of this friend. It is bizarre and incredibly interesting to think that some automatic subconscious process could generate a linguistic response like that while the conscious mind was otherwise occupied. It's times like this that I wish I was a neuroscientist and that all this psychonautics was happening in a controlled environment with proper neurological observation. But stranger than that was that about four hours in, my friend gets a text from his girlfriend about something and has to go meet her... and he does! All while I'm still more or less writhing around lost in some kind of cognitive time loop and feeling very sick (if feeling anything at all). He made sure I was alright with him leaving first, of course. He somehow managed to put himself together and act normal enough that people didn't realize he was on anything serious. He said this was difficult, pretty much focusing complete attention on staying associated. I presume former experience with DXM and other drugs meant he had a pretty good grasp on how to handle himself under the influence. A few days later he smoked some weed (normal amount, in his words ""only one hit"") and blacked out. His buddy says that he became completely nonsensical the whole time he was blacked out, and was constantly laughing and pretty much had to lay down. Very bizarre thing, especially for a guy who smokes a lot. Definitely related somehow to the DXM. So yeah, rough summary is that DXM is weird and has potential to not be a fun time. You probably all knew that before, but I feel it's worth getting slightly unusual reports out there for the public consciousness, harm reduction, etc. Submitted by - Hesychasm","['3 dimensional textures', 'autonomous entities', 'drifting', 'external hallucination', 'holes', 'nausea', 'spaces and voids', 'thought loops']",1252
Experience:1000mg / 1200mg / 1400mg / 1600mg - heroic doses,"1000mg mg, a 14mg/kg dose, and floated thorough various alien landscapes, i could see through my eyes and my room morphed millions of times, and an overweight black woman's voice was my leading entity. i blacked out (or maybe just completely dissociated for several hours). i woke up or came to at 4:00pm, and my whole body felt like it was made out of lead, like a DPH body load, it became a profound thought to me that ""Carl from Aqua Teen Hunger Force is actually the Zodiac Killer"". i dosed another 300, and had bizarre multicolored CEVS, heard some voices, and had psychotic thought, which is different from the usual black and white alien features of the trips, so i think i may have had a ""mini-sigma"" experience. i slowly came to, where i was ""kind of stoned"" and could transport back in to abstract multidimensional landscapes while listening to music. and had several episodes of extreme peace and love out of the blue was up until four PM that day, while everything was still somewhat off, and i couldn't masturbate, i slept from 4:00pm to 12:00am this morning, and woke up mostly sober, but with a pervasive feeling of peace. i may dose another 800mg tonight, hope you enjoyed this report. 1068-1100mg- Purchased 3 x average ml of dxm bottle = 1068mg. Have done this multiple times and have done higher but this dose seems to be the right amount. I would only recommend to people who can handle a journy more than a trip but have always had the best and most intense experience listening to trance like music with my lights off and eyes closed. I visited the past, present, future and talked to spirits or beings from multiple places. I never had any problems with DXM other than at this level its is extremely hard to walk and talk and basically do anything, especially finding things, perception is just not normal, the only way I can describe it. It brought me back to memories and happy thoughts I had repressed for years. It had serious spiritual and awakening effects. It takes you to other planets and realms and shows you what life is really like. The only thing is sometime I feel like I learned the key to the universe but cant quite remember it. It takes you for a ride that is hard to explain but buckle down. But the seeing through your eyes thing and your room morphing into anything you want it to does happen. My room has been a playground for space travels and journeys to other realms. 1200mg (with more tolerance)- I purchased 1200mg of DXM, 64mg of CPM, and three whippets. There was no nausea going down, and I complimented the dose with 20oz of white grapefruit juice. I started getting hot, sweaty, and forgetful on the comeup. I inhaled the first whippet in the dark, and saw small orbs of green energy shooting green energy to a larger green orb. I was feeling more and more fucked up, and did the other whippets, where green matrices and rays became a three dimensional landscape, and an entity was taking me along the way. I saw several versions of reality from that perspective. One problem I've always had with DXM is I'm always to energetic to sit down in the dark and experience the visuals, so I only spent a few minutes having my body be pulled and float through the blackish-grey landscapes and structures. From then on I was running back and forth to the computer room and the dark room, experiences cartoony reality, the darkness world, and when closing my eyes in the computer room, an aura world of orange, green, and yellow light. I did another thing I always did, and walked through the house with my eyes closed, creating extremely distorted alterate designs of my house. After this point I blacked out for four hours, I remember watching Regular Show, but nothing of the episodes. When I came too, I was back on a happy and fuzzy reality, where i slowly went back to sober. 1400mg - Starting transporting into the past and the future, blacked out and went to hospital, broke hospital restraints. Slept for days. 1600mg - Blacked out, slept for 48 hours. in retrospect i would say there are only two ""regular"" plateaus of dxm. the uppity weird high that is the mild at the first and stronger second, and being lost in your inner realities, which is a third plateau, and the fourth plateau is just a feature of the peak of the third plateau where you will ""black out"", may have OBE's, and become fully intrenched in the inner realities. a high dose DXM trip also has perhaps four or five separate stages, the first is the comeup where you begin to feel hot and sweaty, slightly bouncy, and a tinge of derealization, you may feel highly empathetic to others. the second is where you start falling into your other realities, but still are aware of external stimuli, such as music playing, or someone walking into your room, which is what people usually consider the ""third plateau"", the the third is where you lose most memory, but only process your inner world, which is considered the ""fourth plateau"", the fourth stage is when you come back to consciousness, and feel an extreme body load, but think more clearly, and have the ""choice"" to go into your inner world, where the hallucinations are brightly colored, and nonsensical. this is the ""sigma"" stage, which is on a spectrum, and depending on the dosage regimen can land you into the full blown psychedelic psychosis ""which is plateau sigma"", the fifth stage is a sense of derealization and afterglow that may last several days and slowly tapers off.

Experience:DXM 1200mg - A calm flood.,At around 9:00pm i mixed 1000 mg of DXM extract in a can of Barqs rootbeer and drank the whole can. I then went down into my room feeling a little nauseated which is expected. I went and laid down in my bed in a comfortable position and played Bianural beats through my earbuds and tried to relax. In the first 10 minutes i felt super calm but drowsy and tired but kept myself awake to experience the high. After about 25 minutes later i closed my eyes and laid until i entered a daydream like state where i had seen vivid colors on in the darkness of my eyelids. I laid there for an amount of time i cant recall and just sunk into my bed in complete bliss. Soon after that i had either began hallucinating or fell asleep either way it was a very strange and vivid dream in which i was at a local skating rink filled with random people but it felt different as if outside the building was just in space floating through yet not affecting the gravity within the building. All of a sudden while skating (which is something i don't enjoy too much irl) i saw a girl who i knew from my life there and we experianced a connection where we felt as pawns within our own world. I woke up shortly after around 6:30am and instantly forgot about the dream until a bit later but i still can not recall who the girl was only that i know her personally.

Experience:750mg - Experiencing Void; Dissociation Of Reality And Self,"The following report follows my personal experience with 750 milligrams of the dissociative drug ""Dextromethorphan"" through oral administration of Robitussin Dry Cough Forte. Due to the intense nature of the experience, a large portion of specific details are hard to encompass or remember, I will try to describe the experience thoroughly and in detail, this report will hopefully help the reader reference for whatever curiosity or reason you entitle your action too. The experience started off with me orally consuming 250 milliliters of cough syrup in a glass cup, in total 750 milligrams of Dextromethorphan over a short period of about 15 minutes. Due to the lack of stomach content at the time, subjective effects were felt rather more quickly than I had expected them to take action, starting of with a stimulative like awareness of my surroundings, inanimate objects were perceived as an ""alive"" or significant quality of depth and meaningfulness. An example could be four tea candles that I had lit to attribute to the setting of the experience, they took on a serene nature, the stillness of the candles sent off a stimuli which caused emotions of tranquil solitude, slightly more intense vibe was struck from the environment that encompassed me. As a short period passed, the come up was still furthering toward a ""second plateau"" experience. It became rougher to discern the effects that were present, so I decided to put the candles out and move to the bed, turned on my laptop to read a few trip reports of Dextromethorphan in the third and fourth plateau stages, what I was reading wasn't very promising to what I ""thought"" may happen. The experience was becoming more than what it was before, the feeling of awareness was significantly heightened, I felt the mind and body dissociation in its early stages. I was becoming extremely anxious, seeing that it hasn't been half an hour since I started consuming the syrup, this ensured me that I was far from close to what I am about to experience soon. I tried to relax, so I threw on a few tunes to try and calm my mind and attempted to sink in with the experience, this briefly assisted but eventually the music lost its soothing vibe, the experience was augmenting its power quickly and constantly. Nausea insinuated negativity upon me, I lost my comfort and started feeling much regret about going through with this, I felt like a complete fool as to why I'd do this to myself. I couldn't concentrate on positive aspects of the experience, all I felt was a shame, fear, sickness, and dysphoria; I just wanted to sleep and end it, but the hysteria and dissociation made it hard to rest, I had only one choice: face what I had started. Nausea turned to an ordeal pain; I felt isolated, so I decided to call my partner for some security. She answered, at this stage it was just possible to maintain normal conversation, I wanted to tell her what I was doing, hoping she may able to comfort me during the experience, but all that'd do is terrify her and cause more problems, so I decided to halt the conversation and tell her I was ""going back to bed"". I couldn't take it anymore; I tried so hard to hold the liquid in as I felt the psyche slowly tear away from my body, followed by reality itself. I could feel the vomit coming up my throat, so I had to make the instant decision to get up and let it out beside the bed. The release prompt a feeling that I'd ""purged"" out the negative aspect of the trip, I can't explain how much better and comfortable I felt after it, it slightly turned the tables of the experience, but I still had to deal with being ripped from reality. I stumbled with moderate difficulty to the other side of the bedroom and stripped myself down to bare bottom to change from my puke riddled clothing. Afterward, I proceeded to clean up the vomit on the floor with a towel. Easily enough it soaked up like a sponge, and I climbed back into bed, and this is where the experience turned into the most profound moment in my lifetime. As I laid still among the dark, I sunk into what was happening to me and attempted to stop fighting the experience and let go of my conscious reactions to the trip and let the DXM take me to where ever it wanted to send me. I found this decision a lot better, I relaxed and morphed my physical self, or what was left of it, to the reality I was leaving behind; Reality became nothing more than my senses perceiving distorted stimulus of what it could identify. I started talking to something, whether it was my individual self, subconsciousness or an internal or external entity, asking ""where is here?"", where is there?"". I could still know what my address was, but it seemed irrelevant and tedious, my mind felt like it didn't exist there anymore; it existed here in the void, this realm of nothing yet everything. Time became exceedingly difficult to perceive, it went forwards and backward, fast and slow; I couldn't understand even the slightest and most simple concepts of time and metaphysics. I closed my eyes, only to be met upon by streaks of lights moving in a slashing motion, and an entity that took on the form of a snowflake structured reptilian elf looking thing, meditating in the lotus position while it floated in the darkness of my eyelids and said ""why do you do this"", I couldn't find an answer to the question, and it quickly dissipated. I was then in the event of perceiving walls and body parts dramatically changing size, one minute I'm in an infinite field of absolute, the next I was consumed by the room that sized down to the area of a cardboard box like I was going to be forever trapped in this box for eternity. The remainder of the experience was difficult to remember, the only thing that my mind processed was perceptual stimulus, vision, and sound thought and consciousness was dulled or fictitious, to my memory I possibly fell asleep, only to repeatedly wake up to the dissociation again and again. I awoke the next morning, still feeling slightly distant from reality, the rest was subjective side effects of depression, but had since dissipated. The conclusion of the experience isn't necessarily positive; my venture into the void-like state of mind created by Dextromethorphan was akin to experiencing hell or possibly death, the experienced welcomed me but my connection of veneration with this world is too strong to have the feeling of losing it forever, or in another view of how much the experience of dissociative substances differs from the wonderful classic psychedelics, well it wasn't exactly pleasant in my personal experience, but to others it may be embraced and revered, but to others (In similarity to my account) it shows quality of the opposite. NOTE: The experience profoundly differs from individual to individual, do not take my experience as to what you may experience with this substance, it may be pleasant and beneficial, or it can be terrifying and traumatizing, do plenty of research before consuming a substance for the first time!

Experience:700mg - To the dextroverse.,"12:20pm Took 700mg of pure powdered DXM; method of ingestion was via three bombs/parachutes. There were two other people present; josikins, who was taking the same dose as me, and a sober friend/sitter. 12:40pm First plateau/Starting to feel the effects of the DXM; tingling feeling at the end of fingers and toes, and slightly dizzy. 12:50pm 2nd plateau/Dissociation starting to come-on. Very floaty headspace. When moving, it feels like I am on auto-pilot. 1:20pm Me and my other dissociated friend spent a little time recording ourselves on my webcam. It was at this point that I was starting to find it difficult to string sentences together, and could not just talk naturally without having to force the words out. After this point, I cannot remember the whole experience, due to being in and out of the ""d-hole"" for the next six hours. Most of my awake moments only involved me opening my eyes, mumbling a few words and passing back out again a few seconds later. However, I can remember specific events occurring. 3rd/4th plateau I was feeling completely detached from my body, like I was just a mind that was completely separated from anything. Everytime I had to move, I would just find myself in the place I needed to be, with barely any recollection of the actually transition from one room to another. It was as though my body was on autopilot, all I had to do was think about going somewhere and I would suddenly be in that room. The parts where I remember walking, it was very difficult to control my motor control, and getting anywhere required holding onto walls, banisters etc the whole way. I remember feeling very disorientated, and panicking that my parents had been trying to get in touch with me. I tried looking at my phone, but where my vision was blurry, I couldn't make out any of the writing on the screen, meaning I couldn't tell whether I had been called. In the end, my sitter had to remove my phone and turn it off, to prevent me from calling my parents. I was repeatedly asking my sitter whether I had been contacted, but then forgetting I had asked seconds later. I apparently kept asking where I was, due to the memory loss, and had to be calmed down as I was appearing to be becoming scared. The visual side of the trip wasn't as strong as the dissociating side. However, I remember on several occasions flying through a void, surrounded by pixelated buildings (think Minecraft). The colors were darker than I experience on psychedelics like LSD and psilocin; mostly the darker shades, or greys/metallic colors. During the brief periods where my eyes were open, I remember thinking that everything had a very Cubist/Picasso look to it. It was as though any object I looked at had been chopped up, and rearranged. As well as looking different, objects had completely different textures to what I was used to. The whole room was blurry and I was experiencing double vision when I tried to focus on one particular thing. When just glancing briefly upon anything, although I had no double vision, the object would leave behind blurred tracers. At several points during the trip, I remember seeing people I knew in the room that weren't actually there. One hallucination I had was where the trip I was currently having and a memory of a trip with three of my friends merged together. The friends in my hallucination I actually saw seated around me and moving. However, outside of that hallucination, any people that weren't physically in the room, I could just feel a sort of presence of. Towards the end of the experience, there were a few interesting things I noticed. I started to come down around seven. I could keep my eyes open for longer, and could start to talk more easily. I still had memory loss; minutes would feel like hours. I had a period of feeling about a foot shorter that I really was. If I looked down at my legs, they looked incredibly short. My surroundings seemed larger than normal too. I was also left with an afterglow of feeling rather awake and talkative, staying up until 3am talking. Food also tasted bland or just had no taste, as well as the textures feeling slimier than normal. After the peak of ego death, I said several times that I regretted taking the DXM and wouldn't do it again. However, the further away I got from ego death, the more I started to consider DXM to be one of the more interesting and profound trips I've ever had.

Experience:535mg - My First DXM Trip,"Obtained the DXM: I walked into CVS by myself and spent a good 5-10 minutes looking through their cough syrup for just what I needed. It was Dextromethorphan Polistrex, which is the longer acting form of DXM. This detail was unimportant to me at the time. First Dose: I was originally going to take only a low dose of about 120mg but I decided that I was gonna be okay with a higher dose my first time because when I took LSA for the first time I took 800 Morning Glory seeds and it was an amazing time. So I downed about 250mg which is half the bottle. Second Dose: About 30 minutes after the first dose I decided that 250mg wouldn't be enough for me so I drank the rest of the bottle. So now there's 535mg in me. Everything was going well: I laid in bed while listening to music and closing my eyes, waiting for the geometry to start. The geometry gradually set in and at this point, it's 45-60 minutes after the second dose. Uh-oh: I started feeling like I was dying. It's funny when I think back on it but while it was happening I was like yeah this is it. While making my way to the bathroom, everything was slower than I've ever seen it. Like 3 frames per second. Everything felt very distant and I got the bright idea of getting in the shower. Probably the worst thing I could've done. I had never experienced dissociation like this before (besides laughing gas at the dentist) so I didn't know what to expect. I got in and turned on the water and I couldn't feel what temperature the water was. Now I'm REALLY starting to flip out. I get out of the shower and go to the laundry room and throw up in the toilet. My heart was racing and I didn't know what to do. I told my mom that I was sick and I needed to go to the hospital and she said okay. So I went to the hospital and was there until about 2 AM. I specifically remember hearing voices while I was there. One of the voices said that something happens once every 1,000 years. No idea what that's supposed to mean. The universe was probably trying to tell me that I messed up. Conclusion: The trip ended up lasting about 4 days. Every time I would wake up, everything was still 3 frames per second. I know now that I have the CYP2D6 deficiency. I only need to take 120mg to have a good trip with geometry that lasts at least 2 days.

"Experience:354mg DXM, weed, nicotine - Descending into the void","At midnight, I grabbed an empty water bottle and quietly left my house. When I got to my car outside, I opened the trunk and tore the plastic thing off of the cap to a single bottle of cough syrup. I poured it into my water bottle as quickly as possible, then tucked my water bottle under my shirt, closed my trunk, and snuck back inside. I really don't want to be caught on drugs by my parents, because over the years I've convinced them that I'm straight-edge. I got to my bathroom and poured water into the water bottle. (The mixture was about 2 parts cough syrup to 1 part water.) I have a much easier time ingesting cough syrup if it's slightly watered down, just to change the gross texture. I drink it over the course of 15 minutes while listening to Death Grips on shuffle. I don't quite remember how, but I found my way to a really long Wikipedia article on the eight circuit model of consciousness. By the time I finish reading, I'm nearing the final stages of the come up. I go back into my bathroom, unlock my lockbox, and pack a HUGE bowl of weed into my pipe. I smoke weed daily, but only in very small portions. The biggest bowl I usually smoke is about 0.1g. This bowl was easily 3x larger than my typical bowl. Anyways, I go outside and smoke that shit. As I near the end of the bowl, an airplane flies overhead. I'm not a ""spiritual"" person, but I always consider a plane flying overhead at night when I'm smoking to be a good omen, and I always have a great high after seeing one. I know it's psychological and not neurological, but the highs I get after seeing a plane (which is pretty rare) are the best. By the time I completely finished the bowl and blew it out, I was feeling very dizzy. When I'm outside smoking, I keep my eyes closed unless I'm taking a hit. I decided to open my eyes to look at the trees, they were flowing upwards really intensely. The edges between the tops of the trees and the sky were dancing. It looked like black fire on a dark blue backdrop. I made my way back towards my house (about 150 feet) and when I passed my dad's truck, my vision jerked violently. The front of my dad's truck looked like a gigantic mouth with jagged teeth, snapping at me repeatedly. At this point, I was pretty terrified but I told myself to be brave. I walked past the truck and up to the steps leading up to the side door to my house. Each step appeared to be composed of many smaller steps, and each smaller step was composed of smaller steps, etc. This fractal affect was incredibly disorienting so I closed my eyes and climbed them by feel, even though I was really dizzy. I made it back to my bathroom to put my pipe and lighter away. It usually takes me about three minutes to get my weed stuff packed away, gloves and flashlight put away, etc. During the entire duration I had an intense fear of looking in the mirror, I thought that if I looked inside of it and saw my own eyes, I would be trapped in the mirror forever. Every sensation (visual, auditory, and tactile) felt distant and artificial. I think this is what derealization is. When I made it back to my room, I sat at my computer and put Death Grips on again. Though I've listened to every Death Grips song many times before, every song seemed completely new and different. I found my cheapo vape pen (nicotine, not more weed), and started inhaling nonstop because I had read about how nicotine greatly potentiates DXM's dissociative effects and I've never tried it before. I stopped paying attention to everything, and suddenly I was struck with a sensation I've never felt before. I felt my head expanding as I shot forward in space, which was really overwhelming, so I decided to turn the lights off and get in bed. When I got in bed, I pressed my thumbs into my eyes to induce entoptic hallucinations, something I do regularly when I smoke weed. For some reason, nothing was happening and I was only seeing black, but I felt some sort of pressure building. When I took my hands away from my eyes, it felt the pressure burst and I saw incredible patterns of vibrant and almost overwhelmingly bright colors. The two most prominent and memorable were a gigantic neon green eye over my whole vision bright yellow veins and spider webs over my whole vision When these faded, I decided to put my headphones back on, and listen to a five-minute track of women screaming on youtube. I can't really say why I thought this was a good idea. My heart was racing by the end. As soon as it finished, a dark blue cloud started growing in my vision. It expanded until it reached the edge of my field of vision, then my field of vision started expanding (what felt like) infinitely. I completely lost connection with physical sensation, but at the same time, I felt my body stretching out vertically. It felt like I was ten feet tall. I felt my now-stringy body swirling, spinning, and spiraling into different shapes. As this was happening, I also had a sensation of traveling through space on my bed. It became more and more intense, and eventually, I saw myself on the side of a slowly-rotating cone-shaped machine. I looked around and saw many more of these cone-shaped machines flying through the black void I was in. I looked closer, and saw that there were many more beds (which were more like the monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey, with other people attached to them. I looked to my sides and saw that my cone-machine also had more people on it, too. I looked closer and saw that they were all me, except they all had my long hair I had when I was growing up. (I had long hair for my entire life until I recently decided to shave my head and grow a mohawk.) I looked back to the other cone-machines, and the people on all of them were also me, with my old long hair. I felt the cone machines descend until eventually, I was at the edge of a hollow cylinder (directly under me) about 5 feet in diameter and about 100 feet tall. The cylinder passed through the cone-machine. When I reached the bottom of the cylinder, my body didn't pass through, so I was left in the bottom of the cylinder as the cone-machine continued to descend. My stretched-out body sat comfortably in the cylinder, which I now considered to be ""my hole"". The bottom of my hole was a perfect hemisphere, and was filled with soft shapeless blobs, which I considered to me ""my pillows"". Keep in mind that the only REAL pillow in my bed was the one underneath my head, even though I felt ""my pillows"" all around my body. I lied in my hole for what felt like eternity, and as I looked around, I could see hundreds of other ""me's"" sitting in their holes all around me in space. I thought every thought that was thinkable, saw every object seeable, heard every sound hearable. I know this isn't actually possible, but it really felt like it. Their holes were scattered around, always very distant from each other. Some were too high above me to look at and some were too far below me to look at. After what felt like forever, my assigned cone-machine came from underneath me and brought me back up, out of my hole and back into reality. I ""woke up"" in my bed, looked at my phone, and the time was 4:30 AM. I went back to sleep. This experience was the most incredible experience I've had with any drug. I've tried 4g of mushrooms a few times before, and DXM many times as well too. I've even had 800mg DXM before, but this 354mg trip was the most incredible I've had.

Experience: 300mg DXM (Oral) - Brink of the third,"At around 3pm, I took out 20, 15mg, DXM Gelcaps from the bottle, and 1 single 25mg DPH pill. I was mostly hoping to go somewhere close to the third plateau, and I think I got pretty close, I have a weak liver and the bupropion heavily potentiates DXM. The DPH was to help with nausea, which didn't end being a good idea for me. DPH is actually potentiated by my medication as well, although I do not know which one? Perhaps the Bupropion. So I took the pills, then waited and played osu! and talked with my boyfriend over discord. at around the 30min mark I started feeling heavy and drowsy, probably from the DPH which always makes me feel that way. I was thinking the DXM would probably wake me up, and it did! Although I felt very heavy during the trip but that might have been because that was the highest (high for me) dose that I took at the time. After about 30 more minutes, I started feeling the DXM come up, it was very intense but I surprisingly didn't have any nausea at all, the DPH had worked well! It felt very euphoric as this was the highest dose I had done so far but also felt very heavy and groggy because of the DPH, so it was kind of a weird feeling although enjoyable. For a while I stared at my ceiling and it genuinely looked like it was shifting and moving around, the spots on my ceiling looked like waves and I could see many small patches of brown dots all over it, which I don't notice now. Heavy dissociation as well, and my body was almost completely sedated as touch was weird and I did not feel pain. Fun mirages: I've always had this way of doing DXM but I would lay down on my bed with headphones, blast loud music (mostly things with heavy bass like EDM and Electro House or whatever) and simply lay down, chill, and put my arm around my eyes to block all light. Closing my eyes, I instantly felt like I was looking into a dark void instead of just my closed eyelids, then started seeing soft flashes of light and then my imagination started becoming extremely clear and vivid (Note: I had been reading Dorohedoro for a few days before this). If I tried to ""unfocus"" my eyes, my imagination would take over and I would be thrown into the hallways of the Dorohedoro manga, it was quite disturbing as my music was kind of scary and I saw vivid images of gigantic monsters pulling an entire city from their arms, a girl's eyes being gouged out with a scalpel (as well as feeling like I could softly feel the scalpel cut my own eyes), then her head ripping off and coming out with the spine. Although those scary vivid ""dream"" like states stopped as soon as I took off my headphones. With nicer music I usually tried to focus on the actual closed eye  visuals of the drug, they were mostly geometric-like shapes, like cogs and triangles or snowflakes, fractals I think? They were super pretty to look at and changed subtly with the music as I laid there for a good 15mins or 30mins listening to songs on my bed, describing what I was seeing to my boyfriend. Occasionally vivid hallways of fractals came into my vision fast and faded and then came back in black and white, manga panel style. Time Distortion: Time felt extremely slow, everything looked slow in fact as my pupils were about 90% dilated. 2mins felt like an hour and an hour felt like 5 hours. Everytime I would close my eyes and see things, it would feel like an actual place I went to. Immersion: The dissociation made it extremely easy for me to think I was actually in the videos I was watching, I watched alot of AMVs and genuinely felt like I was a part of those videos, it gave me a lot of intense euphoria and I felt extremely satisfied, like I had spent an entire summer with my friends, but it had only been 4 minutes. Also the food tasted god awful and I couldn't feel my tongue. OEVs?: After about 6 hours or so of doing nothing but talking, being happy, feeling like I was on the verge of cumming because of how intense and amazing music felt, and generally a lot of staring, I headed to bed and closed off all my lights, my room was in pure darkness. I stared into the deep void with my eyes open, I could see vivid stroke-like geometrical patterns everywhere, the extremely faint light from the outside slowly shifted and turned and my room was waving around and everything looked like I was looking at a video, I stared at it for a good 20mins in pure awe over what my brain could do. I had intense tracers from small amounts of light and when I checked my phone, it would look like it lagged behind time at 30fps and everything looked extremely smoothened and pretty, if I stared into my phone, the surrounding darkness would turn into a galaxy and stars would appear, time would feel like it almost froze I was incredibly happy. Afterglow: I fell asleep after that but kept waking up every hour, so my sleep wasn't very good (Slept for 7 hours), still felt high the next day but a lot less high than before, I think this was an afterglow and during the afterglow my muscles were still not very well coordinated, I couldn't pee very well and generally music still felt orgasmic, I felt light euphoria and was generally a lot more empathetic. This afterglow lasted about 3 days. (Probably because I take bupropion every night and that might potentiate the remaining dxm in my system).

Experience:300mg DXM + 25mg DMT + Cannabis - A crazy night,"Holy smokes. Was this a crazy night. Okay, let’s get into it. I start out picking up two bottles of CVS Tussin (DXM, 300mg). A guy hits me up outside of the store and is insistent on me giving him a ride to his car. I tell him no, but he’s very persistent and feeds me a story about his kids being stuck at daycare. I drive him a couple miles to the drop-off, and then he starts demanding I give him money. I only had seven bucks, and I told him no over and over again, but this fucker was persistent. I finally gave him the money just to get him the hell out of my car. He said he would call me the next day, but I had great doubts (I never got a call..) After this, I headed over to pick up a friend of mine Lewis from his college dorm. We headed back to my place, and it turns out it was Lewis’s birthday. I said the kush was on the house today, and I rolled up a joint. We smoked and got decently stoned, and then surfed the web reading about drugs. After an hour or so, I rolled up another one, and we smoked it. Then, the DXM began tempting us. I had only taken DXM once before, and that was at least a year ago. Lewis had never taken it, so we decided to pop some capsules. He took the entire container (300mg) and I started with 120mg. From there, we decided that we would uber to a friend of our’s house. I brought the DXM along and planned to take the rest of it as the night went on. Our uber driver was barely literate in English, and his GPS was taking us all over the city. Finally, Lewis used his GPS to get us to our destination, and at this point, we both started feeling the DXM quite nicely. Our friend Slater met us at the door with one of his roommates who was going out to buy alcohol. We chatted for a minute and then headed upstairs to Slater’s room Side note (this will be important later) - I had recently lost my wallet, and I only brought 5$ along with me. Five bucks and a half empty bottle of DXM capsules. The three of us chatted for a bit, catching up on stories and what’s been going on in each other's lives. I took the rest of the DXM, finishing the entire bottle around 2:30AM. At one point, Slater mentioned that a couple of his roommates had DMT. I was impressed, caught off guard, and yet still somewhat skeptical. It wasn’t until his roommate Alex came up (who had just candy flipped [LSD+MDMA]) and told us a little bit about it. I’d known about DMT since I was a senior in high school, and always had a curiosity, and respectful caution surrounding it. I really didn’t think I would ever come into contact with the spirit molecule. At least not this early. Alex acknowledged our curiosity and headed back downstairs. Shortly after, he came up with a kind looking man with wide eyes and dilated pupils. Brendan. “You guys want a hit of DMT?”. Was I actually just offered DMT?! “Yes please.” I say, voice sounding that of an excited yet scared child. “Alright.” he says slowly “That’s going to take a little while”. Holy shit. This is actually happening. I’m actually about to smoke DMT. Why tonight? Are these the right circumstances? I’m already tripping on DXM, should I actually smoke DMT? Some say one of the best tips for psychedelic drugs is “Don’t seek them out, let them come to you”. Tonight was a night where I suddenly had DMT in front of me. After waiting for what seemed like an hour, he returned upstairs with a small glass pipe with some crystals in the bulb at the end of it. There is was. DMT. No funny business with sprinkling it in a weed bowl, or making some weird contraption. The perfect pipe, and a blowtorch to heat it evenly. Oh my God, there it is. I became very anxious. I started to shake a little, and my heart beat increased. I couldn’t believe it was there in front of me, and I was about to take it. Now, as with just about any drug, there is going to be a cost involved. Brendan was not charging ridiculous prices for DMT at all. “5 a hit.” he said. Oh wow. Perfect. I have exactly five dollars. This reaffirmed my idea that I was meant to smoke DMT tonight. One hit, and nothing more. Nothing more and nothing less. This is the experience that I needed to have. Brendan and Alex were two very helpful and calming people. I had so many questions for these experienced DMT users. What the experience would be like, how to prepare, and a number of other questions that I was frantically spitting out. I was nervous, and it was apparent. At one point Alex said, “You seem weary”. I said that I was and that I was very nervous going into the experience. They then gently counseled me. “Just let it flow. Don’t have any expectations. Whatever you get out of it is what you get”. These words of wisdom helped me, though my heart was still beating rapidly. I couldn’t imagine any two other people guiding me through my first DMT experience. The time came to spark the DMT, and Lewis elected to go first. The room became quiet. Even in a large social setting such as this, it was accepted that it must be silent while consuming DMT. Everyone’s eyes were on Noah. He held the pipe, and Brendan held the blow torch close. Lewis inhaled multiple times, getting a small trail of vapor on each inhale. He took quite a few hits and began to shake towards the end. He swayed a little and giggled. This was the first time I had ever seen anyone smoking DMT in person, and it was fascinating. Shortly after, Brendan moved the pipe over towards me. “Are you ready?” he asked. I muttered out something, and he pulled it back “You're not ready??”. Inside, I felt that the nervousness had been dialed back a small amount, however, it was not completely eliminated. I did not want to chicken out. “No, I’m ready. I’m ready”. I held the pipe about an inch away from my lips while he heated it up. “When do I inhale?” I asked, quietly. “When you see smoke”. I let out a very light sight and saw a small trail of smoke appear in the freebase pipe. Time to inhale. I sealed my lips around the pipe and inhaled. The pipe filled with milky smoke, and after inhaling for about 5 seconds, I moved the pipe away from my lips and held it in. The smoke wasn’t too harsh, however immediately after exhaling, and positioned myself so I could lay on the ground. Right as my head hit the ground, I felt the spirit molecule surge through my physical vessel. The room became vibrantly colored and appeared to almost pop out at me. I had visuals similar to this on a dose of LSD, however never this strong or this quickly. There was a sublime poster above me that said, “Just let the lovin’ take hold”. This posters colors all appeared incredibly vibrant and I felt the sheer intensity of this experience. At one point, Lewis burst out into laughter, which began to overwhelm me. I sat up and began to frantically ask “How long will this last?!”. Everyone said five minutes, and this gave me a sense of ease. There was the roommate that I had met at the door, and I was looking around the room for him. I made eye contact with him upstairs, and he was said “Just relax. Take it easy. Just relax”. This gave me such a sense of security and peace. As I peered around the room, I reeled at this experience. I loved the visual effects this was bringing on, and kept saying “I can’t believe this is DMT”. Then suddenly, all of the anxiousness and all of the worry seemed to drop out of my chest. I said it was as if a million dollars had been lifted off my shoulders. I was no longer shaking or breathing fast. The anxiety and tightness in my chest dissipated, and then I suddenly realized that I was in love. I texted my partner “I’m in love, I’m in love. Oh how my heart flutters, I’m in love”. I couldn’t believe it. I felt so amazing. My voice became softer and slower, and I said aloud how great I felt. Alex and Brendan were curious about what I had gotten out of this experience. I had in no way nailed down any thoughts about this experience. My words just flowed. I told them I was so incredibly anxious and worried, and these worries had been completely eliminated and replaced with a profound love. They smiled and talked about how much joy it brought them to see people undergoing this experience. I had been having serious doubts about my relationship over the course of the few months that I’ve been with my partner. I had an oddball of anxiety inside me that I couldn’t seem to get rid of and had doubts that didn’t deserve attention. An indefinable anxiousness. After this DMT experience, that anxiety appears to be completely gone. That tightness in my chest and that constant push to be doing the right thing was eliminated. I felt amazing after smoking DMT. I asked Brendan for more, however, he said that I would have to wait to take any more. I figured I had an amazing experience, and I would save future steps into the world of DMT for later on. At around 3:30AM, an uber pulled up to Slater’s house and the three of us (Lewis, Slater and me) all hopped in and drove back to my house. From there, we began one of the biggest smoke downs I’ve had in a long time. They each took some edibles, and then we packed bowl after bowl of weed and kief in my vaporizer solo. After about 4 or 5 vape bowls, and a joint to top it all of, the clock hit 6:30am, and I was on the brink of passing out. I struggled my way up the stairs to my room, and landed in my bed. I slept in until 1:30PM, and woke up feeling..pretty good. I was maybe a tad slower today, however, overall I didn’t feel too much after effects of the large amount of cannabis and DXM. I actually felt pretty good the follow day. Maybe a little high, but overall positive Submitted by - Wispy","['anxiety suppression', 'colour enhancement']",2317
Experience:250mg DXM - DXM Itch and Trip Report,"Today, I will be discussing my experience with Dextromethorphan and the ""DXM Itch"". We were also smoking weed/taking tokes throughout the experience. We went out and purchased one 250ml bottle of DXM no name brand syrup, we did the math and there was 750mg in total. We split the bottle between the three of us, me and my boyfriend taking slightly a bit more than our friend. We had done this syrup many times previous to this and this was the highest dose we had consumed yet. It was slightly difficult to drink it all as usual as the taste is absolutely terrible, but chasing it with Pepsi or some sort of dark pop makes it a lot better. Once we had all drank our portions of the syrup, not long, about 20-25 minutes afterwards, I could feel the affects starting to come on. The first thing I noticed, as usual, was the slight pains in my stomach, almost a slight sick feeling that sort of feels like mild cramps. The next thing that I started to feel , was some visual affects just involving all the colors in the room beginning to stand out and look incredibly bright. The Christmas lights in my apartment began to glow and I started to feel more social. About 45 minutes to and hour in we were all feeling the affects of the cough syrup. Our friend ended up leaving not too long into this, and we put on family guy and continued our trip. Not too long after this, the syrup was generally taking effect. All colors looked incredibly bright and everything was making me laugh more than usual, bong rips became easier to take and i found myself taking huge rips without even barley feeling the affects of the weed. Right around this point is also when the ""DXM Itch"" started to come on for me. I randomly started to notice my whole body becoming incredibly itchy. It started with the bottoms of my feet feeling a burning, itching sensation and then started on my back, my legs, my arms, my whole body. No matter how much I would Itch myself nothing would relieve the itching sensation. I began feeling a really intense burning feeling everywhere that I was Itchy. I broke out into rashes all over my body and had too try not to let anything touch my back. This feeling ended up taking over the rest of the trip I had left (witch was most of it), and making it a very un enjoyable experience for me. This lasted for a couple of hours before the Itching stopped and the affects calmed down and I began to feel tired and went to bed. The next morning, I read online about the ""DXM Itch"" and this is why i have decided to not do the syrup again.

Experience:DXM (125 mg) - Untitled,"11:50: I manage to down a tiny 100ml bottle, out on the street and in broad daylight and I feel nothing. I have to be quick, I hope I don’t get caught with some weird little bottle in my hands. I could have to wait until like 3 PM to feel anything. It’s only a teeny little first or maybe second plateau dose, my first time. I want to try the big guns when I got shopping next week, I’ll see if I can afford a big fat 250ml bottle from somewhere like Boots or Superdrug. 13:00: I might be feeling a weird dissociating feeling, like I’m being lifted up in the air. I’m unsure about how little I took, but I really want to take a much higher dose in the future. Listening to “Pacify Her” by Melanie Martinez, nothing different. In the mirror, I look normal and my pupils are barely dilated. 7 beats measured in 5 seconds, so 84 bpm. In hospital I remember my heart rate being 60 something. 13:10: I’m definitely feeling a little bit dizzy but I’m not entirely sure it’s the DXM. 13:15: I’m getting really frustrated at myself for A. picking a stupidly low dose and B. being too fat to get high. When I got the opportunity to smoke pot almost a year ago, I reported little to no effects at all. I was probably slightly heavier (like 50 kg) than I am now, but not loads and loads. And the short thin girl was boasting about how stoned she was getting instantly after her first few hits. I don’t feel like I’m writing this, it feels like someone else is. For fuck’s sake, I’m such a fool, such a stupid motherfucking fool, for buying a tiny little 100ml bottle. I was in a rush. I might not regret it later, but you’ll never know. I’ve learnt my lesson. If you want a 2nd plateau dose, you’ll still need enough millilitres of cough syrup for a 3rd plateau dose because the stuff is sticky as hell and it’s hard to consume all of it. 13:20: There’s this weird feeling in my forehead. It’s definitely not a headache, but I feel so light and dizzy. I can’t even be bothered to work out how many hours since, erm, I drank it on the street. 13:30: In the mirror, my pupils look slightly large than normal, or might do. Played “Savages” by Marina and the Diamonds, doesn’t sound too different but maybe a little bit. As I dance to the bridge of “Savages”, my arms feel a tad heavy. Oh, fuck, I’m stuck with like £14 left, more than enough for a real robo-trip, but certainly not enough to afford a robo-trip and a gram of weed and some video games. So, if the come-up begins at 1, I could be waiting until like 2 or 3 for the real thing. In the meantime, let’s robo-dance to “Perhaps Vampires Is A Bit Strong” by Arctic Monkeys. An 100ml bottle has 150mg. Thank god I’m fucking 45 kg. My younger, chubbier self at 65 kg would have needed 162.5 mg for a 2nd plateau dose! 13:40: I’m really starting to feel that dizzy feeling. I don’t know if the happiness and stimulation is caused by the drug, or the music. TBH, I’m probably a bit more relaxed. If I wasn’t under the influence, I’d flinch at approaching footsteps. Can’t wait to raid my aunt’s cupboard tomorrow and get high off her codeine, whatever the hell I can find in there. Let’s just turn the music off and see if I still feel weird and euphoric without the music. 13:41: My pupils may have grown, but not as much as the MDMA pupils I see on TikTok and stuff. 13:50: As I close my eyes, I can imagine, but not see or hallucinate, myself, the way I am now, in a black and white Carhartt top and camo joggers, standing in a black void, with my eyes closed. I don’t know if it’s just one of those imaginative thoughts I get all the time, or if I’m really on DXM. I look at myself in the bedroom mirror and wonder if that person is really me. I still feel as hungry as I did before I drank any of the syrup, so I’m going to get lunch soon. I’m aware that DXM reduces appetite, but I haven’t had that yet (I’m such a fat fuck). DXM would be the second dissociative I’ve ever done, after the nitrous oxide I puffed in hospital. I really, really want to K-hole one day. PyschonautWiki says that on the 2nd plateau, music should should very rich, clear and bassy. 13:56: I feel a little but tired, but not in the kind of tired you get after staying up until 2 AM watching TV or playing video games and desperately wanting to sleep. 14:00: I’m feeling this weird tingly sensation in my temples. 14:15: I make myself some marmite and low-fat vegan butter on toast (234 kcal) but I fail to finish the second slice. I’m going to see if I can nibble at the other one without feeling too satiated. Let’s go outside. And as I walked downstairs to prepare my food, I felt a sense of unreality. Taking two bites of the second slice, I don’t think I need more food. I might come back to it later. 14:20: My bony ass sits on the grass. let’s go back inside, but I don’t want to ruin my joggers or notebook. No hallucinations so far. Overall, I just feel dizzy, clumsy and less hungry. I can imagine myself from a third-person perspective. I’ll go back to my room, read the psychedelic colouring book, it has a list of things to do under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. I hope I didn’t use more than 10g butter or 8g marmite because I’m high on fucking DXM. 14:30: As I clumsily crashed into my chair, I wondered what I could do while on this drug. So fucking angry at myself for taking such a low dose. Second plateau doesn’t sound that bad, but the first plateau, is the worst. I listed: playing video games dancing; recording myself dancing reading a book solving puzzle magazines I don’t like the “drunk” feeling people get from low doses of DXM, because I don’t want to get drunk. Alcohol is boring AF, it’s everywhere. I’m into more illegal drugs like weed and acid. 15:05: This euphoria’s really hitting me, I feel drunk, I’m forgetting to tell the time, I feel some derealisation, I’m dancing excessively to make up for the unknown calories of cough syrup. 15:55: I’m definitely feeling it. I’m going to dance and dance and pace and pace. 16:04: I’m still not hungry at all. Time is going by so slowly and I’m hyperactive, it could just be not knowing the calories in cough syrup. 16:20: Stamina enhancement could be one of the things in the trip report. But it could just be ana doing her thing - exercising excessively to compensate for some unknown calories. 16:35: After all that hyperactivity, I got my appetite back and ate lunch. I think I’m slowly returning to sobriety. 17:37: I was trying to watch the Inbetweeners but then I thought of Fufu and Fafa Walla being offered 100ml shots of DXM in the hot tub. “Wanna drink and be merry but you’re on a diet? Micro-dose on Benylin. It even suppresses your appetite. And Adam Lanza claims t also makes you more active?” someone said. The fat one, Fafa Walla, felt nothing at all, but the skinny one, Fufu Walla, felt a few periods of dizziness and nothing else. “It’s not instant. You have to wait 30 to 180 minutes for it to kick in”. 18:49: I don’t trust the scales. If I got slightly tipsy on 150mg maximum, that means I weigh at least like 100 kg.

So I need to be relaxed, don’t drink it on the street. Skip breakfast. No eating at all. You will buy a 250ml bottle and drink all of it. 22:15: What I did today nay have been a waste of money, but at least it taught me some lessons: Always go for the BIGGER box of Robitussin; Wait until you get home to drink it; Try mixing it with water, or better yet, grape juice, to make sure you consume all of it","['anxiety suppression', 'appetite suppression', 'cognitive euphoria', 'depersonalization', 'derealization', 'dizziness', 'motor control loss', 'perception of bodily lightness', 'pupil dilation', 'sedation', 'spontaneous bodily sensations', 'time distortion']",1999
Experience:65mg + 30mg redose - My first experience with diphenedine,"This report is of my first experience with Diphenedine. I took the substance along with my partner (H) and a friend of ours (B). For some background, all of us are fairly experienced with dissociatives and psychoactives in general and we have all previously taken Ketamine, MXE, 3-meo-PCP & Nitrous. I received two grams of Diphenedine, and after performing reagent and allergy tests we decided to take it on a Saturday night. During the allergy test we all noticed a mild numbing of the tongue and roof of the mouth, comparable to cocaine. The Diphenedine itself was a floury white powder, with no smell and a fairly mild chemical taste. We dosed in my apartment at 11:25 PM on a Saturday night. H & I took 65mg and B took 70. We tossed the powder straight into our mouths and washed it down with some juice. An hour into the experience H and I took an additional 30 mg. B had taken some 2-FA and kratom earlier in the day, I had had 2 beers and had been smoking pot throughout the day (although this is baseline for me and rarely affects my experience with other drugs). I had also taken ketamine twice earlier in the week, but I didn’t seem to experience any kind of tolerance. B and I were taking dabs and smoking throughout the experience, and I found that there was some slight synergy between the two. I began to feel light effects, such as head pressure and a slightly ‘spaced out’ feeling around 20 minutes, and at 45 minutes the effects were pronounced. One of the most notable things about our collective experience is how very different the effects were for each of us. I felt slightly dissociated, my mind was fairly blank, and I was experiencing light feelings of body buzzing. H, on the other hand, was consumed by writing poetry and found that the Diphenedine was stimulating and produced strong feelings of productivity enhancement. B was the most dissociated, and the effects seemed more pronounced in her even though she had only taken 5mg more. H was feeling the least effects from the 65mg despite them being the smallest person in the group, and otherwise having no dissociative tolerance. One of the most strongest effects I felt was a wiping of the mind that I haven’t experienced on any dissociative, or any other compound. While B and I were able to keep up a fairly animated conversation, I was only able to focus on one thing at a time and would often find myself forgetting exactly what it is we were talking about. I have read reports of this causing severe amnesia in higher doses, and I can certainly understand why. I have also heard high dose Diphenedine trips described as being comparable to a lobotomy, which I could also see if one were to dose in the high 100’s. I also found that near the end of the experience, around 2 or 3 AM I began to feel very empty and emotionless. I felt disconnected from others and even myself, and it was quite unpleasant. H did not experience this whatsoever. I can’t speak to B’s experience as they walked home at 2:30. We all took some etizolam around 2 AM, although H and I only managed to get to sleep around 5. We woke up the next day feeling slightly groggy from the etizolam but otherwise completely normal. H enjoyed the compound the most and is eager to try it again in the near future. B and I were slightly less enthusiastic, and I would say that this is at the bottom of the list of dissociatives I have tried. I found that the forgetfulness and mind-wipe effects detracted from the recreational potential or usefulness of the compound, although it is important to note that H did not feel this way at all, so it seems the effects of Diphenedine may vary quite drastically from person to person. I found 65mg to be a good initial dose, as it was strong enough to get a feel for the compound without in any way being overwhelming. I found the type of dissociation that the Diphenedine provided fairly bland and totally different from the intricate and magical feelings that you can get on Ketamine or MXE, or the interesting metallic machine-like trip that 3-meo-PCP induces. I’ll try it again in a higher dose but this experience left me feeling somewhat unimpressed. Transcription of my notes taken during the experience: H & I take 65mg, B takes 70 at 11:25 PM. Toss and wash with some juice. T (0:00) - I notice a light numbing sensation on my tongue from the allergy test T (0:20) - First traces of an effect. Mild head pressure. B says the effects have increased substantially for her in the last 2 minutes. T (0:25) - Feeling ever so slightly spaced out. Neutral feeling. T (0:40) - Definitely feeling noticeable effects. My mind seems slightly more blank. Slight, very mild body buzzing. I feel slower. T (0:50) - I feel floaty, mind vacant. T (1:00) - Considering dosing 30mg more H says they are feeling less effects than either B or I. H says “if I had to do homework right now, I could” T (1:35) B is describing double vision, seeing multiple eyes on H and 2 noses on me. H says they are noticing proportion distortion on the text on their cell phone. I am having no visual effects whatsoever. It is 1:07 AM. I can’t do the T (0:00) math anymore, ha. H is feeling stimulated while I feel sedated. Now I feel enhanced effects from the pot. The feelings of thought deceleration are quite pronounced. 1:15 AM - I experienced a brief (15 second) moment of tinnitus and head pressure. We are all experiencing what we agree feels like “negative head pressure”, but not in an unpleasant way. This numbness I’m feeling is not entirely different from ketamine, but nowhere near as magical. It feels more amnesic than anesthetic. B and I are both experiencing repeated forgetfulness. 1:40 AM - I begin to smoke a joint and I almost feel like it makes me more sober. I feel as though I’m on the comedown. It feels smooth though. Passing the joint the B, we fumbled it into a wine glass. I guess we really are dissociated… This substance feels clinical. Somewhat anesthetic. But it provides a fairly bland kind of dissociation. 2:25 AM - We all take some etizolam. H says that the Diphenedine provided a “streamlining of expression: and that the suppression of thought that the drug induced lead to more succinct expression in their writing. I feel very scatterbrained and vacant, but while I was forgetful I never felt overly confused during this experience, as some other reports I’ve read have stated. 2:40 AM - The etizolam begins to take over and the effects do seem fairly synergistic. It may be bringing back some of the pleasant body feelings from earlier? The feeling at this point is quasi-meditative. Very few thoughts. Simple things do seem somewhat confusing. This compound makes you high - but also quite dumb. 2:45 AM - H is writing poetry. This drug made me feel disconnected from others. We are each in our own silent world. 3:30 AM - After I feel baseline I took out the trash and recycling and clean the apartment. This kind of stimulation often happens at the end of an etizolam experience, and I wonder if that has something to do with it.

Experience:50mg - Diphenidine ride,"T+2: Objects and tv became hard to understand, Kevin McCloud was so perplexing and frantically confusing (while watching Grand Designs). Very odd cognitive effects. T+4: I became very sleepy and retired to bed with an eye mask and ear plugs. This is where the effects became more pronounced; I was drifting away, an out of body experience but into another dimension. It was as if I was hallucinating in a sense that I didn't know I had. Instead of visualS (very weak OEVs and stronger CEVs) there was another sense, maybe my psychological model of spatial association, that was extremely distorted. As I lay there for an eternity floating and exploring this gel-like purest black space i became conscious of the fact that the sound of my (racing) heart beat was becoming quieter. Here I postulated at what was happening and maybe I was, in fact, unconscious. The only thing tethering me to this dimensional plane was the light breeze I could feel on my shoulder. Through this, I managed to move my hand up to my mouth, at which point I could open my eyes and was seemingly fine. T+5: I was attempting for a while how to describe the things I saw, these strange shape. But at the same time, they were indescribable objects/shapes, non-shapes. T+6: Sleep came easy with +1mg of etizolam. Strange vivid dreams were had. Summary: Very novel, not much of a party drug but very fascinating effect. I have been theorizing at what sense this drug mainly modulates/distorts and I have come up with several possibilities; is it my spatial association cognitive processing, or maybe the way my brain interprets gravity or incorporates gravity into my model of spatial existence.

Experience:25mg Deschloroketamine - My first time orally dosing DCK,"12:45pm - Eat a gel cap containing 25mg of Deschloroketamine. 1:15pm - I begin to come up. The mental effects are the first to hit, especially Cognitive euphoria 1:25pm - The physical effects are in full effect. 1:45pm - 2pm - The mental and physical effects are in full force. It feels less like a peak than a plateau. There is Physical euphoria especially present when moving. 2pm-4pm - I was in film class during this, watching ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". This is a Chinese movie that had subtitles in English. I was able to watch this movie and the subtitles and follow along with the film, even taking notes. This is contrasted to my experience with large doses of methoxetamine, where I would have to cover one eye with my hand to watch a movie. The double vision was very minor. 4pm - The mental effects are decreasing while the physical effects are still going strong. The double vision seems more prevalent now than it did earlier, which I find interesting. I am able to do Pilates and ""feel the burn"", which is also interesting. I love functional dissociatives. 5pm - The mental effects have pretty much ended and the physical effects linger, especially Double vision. 6pm - I feel pretty much back to baseline. Overall, this was a very pleasant experience. I am surprised at how functional this substance is, even at moderate doses in every day environments.","['3 meo pcp', 'cognitive euphoria', 'color enhancement', 'compulsive redosing', 'double vision', 'increased music appreciation', 'novelty enhancement', 'physical euphoria', 'sedation', 'spontaneous tactile sensations', 'tracers', 'visual acuity suppression']",315
Experience:25mg 3-MeO-PCP - Enhanced film experience,"7am - Wake up, take my morning shower, snort approximately 5mg of 3-MeO-PCP and get ready for my 9 am class. 8:30am - I arrive on campus, I snort approximately 10mg more of 3-MeO-PCP and proceed to my Environmental Science & Human Interactions class. 9am - 11:50am - Since this was only the second lecture it was focused on the interconnection of the world and the different spheres of life that are all coexisting on earth. This lecture was absolutely mind blowing. I was clear headed, my vision was sharp, I was taking killer notes, and my mind was internally exploding at every fact my professor stated. The significance of everything was greatly increased and the epiphany that I was killing millions of insects and bacterium with every foot step staggered me with its importance. I began to dissociate from myself, as a human, and think of the world as a whole. I identified with those insects and bacterium and felt sorrow and guilt for killing them. This feeling reminded me of Jainism, and I pondered on humanity's relationship to the environment for the rest of the lecture. Throughout all of this, I was mentally present and focused. The stimulation and motivation was clean and focused on what I was learning, and I took great joy in the process of learning itself. 12pm - 3pm - Beginning to come down a bit, I sublingual dose 5mg more before my Biology class. This class was less mind-blowing than my previous one, but I was much more interested and fascinated with the subject than usual. I took good notes and made excellent diagrams. 5pm - I'm beginning to come down a bit and resist the urge to re-dose again. I take etizolam which cuts the effects short and has me sedated and asleep by 9pm.

Experience:3-MeO-PCP - Extreme psychosis,"York Bowen Symphony No. 2 It began with a night of binging 3-meo-pcp. I had been using a large amount of the substance working my way through about 500mg over the coarse of a month. I had previously begun to experience ""the fear"" for the first time, my first experience with it being that of sudden onset panic attacks consisting of intense fear abruptly waking me from sleep in a frenzy. These lasted only about 2 minutes each but they foreshadowed the ever escalating madness that ensued. Now I had promised myself I would give up 3-meo-pcp due to the sheer intensity of these experiences, which were unlike any other I've felt on a drug. I am experienced with deliriants and salvia and various psychedelics but the deep pitted existential terror perpetrated by this substance was unparralled. The only thing that surpassed the intensity of this fear was the extremely strong addictive qualities of the substance, and me being a dissonaut with addictive tendencies, I quickly found myself redosing frequently and dosing everyday. Now when your on 3meopcp you don't get psychosis or the fear on the substance, when your on it you just feel extremely manic, you feel the psychosis and the fear when you are coming down during the tail end. When you think your sober. And in one fateful night this perceived sobriety lead to the admittedly poor decision to consume a 20mg dose of 4-HO-MET after a night of long binging where 30-50mg of the substance was consumed. I weighed the powder out with the desire to listen to classical music and experience nice visuals. I lay in my bed with my tablet as I began to come up hard and I struggled as a deep confoundment overtook me. I attempted to put on a piece of music: York Bowens Symphony no 2. This is a beautiful yet menacing composition that I was only able to get playing through extreme struggle. I remember thinking how difficult it was to navigate reality, my vision was deeply altered and it wasn't normal visuals. It felt as though I couldn't focus my eyes and my pupils were dilating in and out. I turned off the lights in an attempt to rectify the situation but it only made it worse. I felt a great intoxication and impairment overtake me. I could not manage to navigate the tablet it was as though brain was unable to render the visual stimuli and i was left with a barrage of incomprehensible noise. the music made little sense to me in this state and I felt completely helpless. I stumbled over to my desktop computer after throwing my tablet on the floor and I crawled into the chair. Completely unable to comprehend what I was perceiving as a layer of unmanageable visuals clouded my field of view I managed to bring up the York Bowen symphony no. 2 only through muscle memory. I don't believe I was able to comprehend how to use the headphones unfortunately but this symphony would have an extremely large impact on my experience nonetheless. This is when my psyche began to unravel. I was in a trance for a good period of time before the paranoia hit. I remember hearing church bells toll that didnt exist, play a melancholy tone. I perceived these as my funeral bells. I started hearing sirens blare and I could percieve my entire family exchanging exasperated concerns for my well being with deep Diaspointment ""He did it again, dissociatives"". I felt my heart race and i began to panic. I could feel my family was on their way and perceived a phone call take place that I conversed in. ""Yes this is the dissociative overdose hotline, beware of DXM abuse. They instinctually knew I had overdosed on 3meopcp, I vocally begged to live, I frantically tossed shelves and broke a picture frame looking for an antidote , all the while begging for redemption from God. I felt i was being punished for being a non believer. I screamed in horror as I fet myself talking to argent begging for an antidote to my fatal poisoning which was slowly encroaching towards my demise who exclaimed in an irritated tone ""really ! Not 3meopcp! hold on I'll see what I can do Jesus Chris t!"" I heard sirens blare and the tolls of death grew ever louder. I was pleading on the imaginary dissociative hotline as i felt myself slipping away I felt incredible guilt and desolution. I felt as I had become a prime example of the downfalls of drug use. I felt I was the patient zero of a dissociative crisis. I looked at my computer and saw the youtube page with the header. York Bowen Symphony No. 2. I felt I was commiting ""York Bowen"" a euphemism for suicide. I screamed begging saying ""I didn't mean too!"". I saw pages of what I had become flash all over the internet and I was known as the person who committed suicide by York Bowen. I felt this deep tragedy as i felt my existence dissapear. Everything ever associated with my identity had become ""York Bowen"" I viewed articles of my demise it was as if my existence had been wiped off the face of the earth, and i had become the first person to die of 3-meo-pcp. I screamed FUCK. FUCK NO. The worst part about it my death was that I would live an identity free life it an eternal purgatory where I lacked identity but roamed in a void of pitiful nothingness that was a copy of this world but nothing I did said or interacted withe over would matter and I completely lacked the ability to influence or interact with any aspect of existence, and that this was entirely eternal. I could hear sirens blare unbearably loud at this point and screams and the church bells tolled the same melancholy tone I screamed and ripped more things from the bookcase throwing all its contents to the floor, exposing the mg scale . I screamed an anguished cry heard by no one and slipped into brief unconsciousness. When I awoke I heard more sirens and a pounding on my door. I was naked when I woke up and the pounding grew ever louder. I had the perception that the police were after me for an imaginary Meth operation and i imagined the entire community mocking me. the pounding wouldn't cease so I opened up the door and was met with nothing. Nobody was there. The colors outside were incredibly bright and vibrant. After hiding all my drugs on obscure places. I fell out of this state of psychosis and fell into deep mania. I poured soap into my hair and lathered it up and then filled a bathtub with water. I felt on top of the world because i felt my actions had no consequence. I felt as though nothing I did mattered because I would just die return into the flow of everything again and start anew form unchanged. I sprayed dish liquid all over the walls and ceiling for reasons I can't explain. I passed out in this tub while the front door of my apartment was wide open. I must of been passed out at least an hour. When I got out I decided i would just go outside to air dry myself instead of using a towel despite being completely naked. I felt like I was in San Francisco in the 1960s, a hippy throwing caution to the wind. Luckily my better judgement overtook me. before i went too far, a good thing considering I lived on a main road in downtown. From here I passed out, mentally and physically exhausted. When I woke up I cleaned up the apartment, and then snorted more 3meopcp and proceeded to order more.

Experience:45mg 2cc & 45mg 4-aco-dmt - Ego death and loneliness,"Most of the memories of my trip are gone, but I can remember a few things that I saw and felt on my trip. At around 1 pm I swallowed a capsule containing the powder and got into bed and watched a few YouTube videos to pass the time with my come up. Within about 30 minutes or so I already started to feel stimulated, so I decided to stop watching YouTube, lay down in the dark and to begin my trip. When I closed my eyes and concentrated I was met with really detailed visuals. I saw what looked like some kind of sweet shop but the whole scene was overlaid with bright colors and snowflake shaped fractals. I could hear what sounded like circus music and children laughing. This began my first shift of my ego. The scene I was seeing made my feel young like a child, although I was still aware of myself I still felt like a different person. I decided to get up at this point and take in my surroundings in my room and see what kind of visuals I would see in my room. I turned my light on and saw that my room was slowly growing and shrinking as if it was breathing. After taking in these visuals, I decided to lay back down in bed in the dark again. When I closed my eyes, it looked like I was in some furniture store though it was pretty empty. The whole scene was pretty neutral in color. I sat up in my bed and my view in the scene changed too. If I moved my head around in real life I had some minor control over where I looked in the trip. I managed to look down and I saw my feet in the trip. I tried moving them in the trip and nothing happened. After concentrating really hard and telling my legs to move I managed to force them to walk. After I took one step I felt extremely proud of myself, as if I had never walked before then. After this happening, I managed to make my vision go black, and I wanted to see how much control I had over what I was seeing. I tried visualizing a door, instead of seeing a door something entirely different manifested. What I saw was some Asian themed room. The walls were red and in the room were vats of some unknown liquid and a few bags with some symbols on. I looked down at my feet and saw my body dressed in some robe that made me think I was some emperor. The scene slowly morphed into what looked like a throne room. The next part of my trip is something I can't remember. The come up was the time from the ""sweet shop, "" and the ""throne room, "" but the memories between the end up the come up to my full on the peak are gone. My memory of the peak is very broken up, I only remember specific parts that seemed to have stood out to me. These are in no particular order. All the peak visuals I saw were full on environments. I could look around freely and no matter where I looked I saw something. It was as if it was a very detailed and intense lucid dream that I had no control over. The night club This scene was exactly this. A night club. It had music, neon lighting, and music playing. The catch was I was ""alone."" People were speaking to me and welcoming me there, but I couldn't see a single person. Eternal Loneliness As I mentioned with 'the night club', I couldn't see anybody. This frustrated me as I fixated on this issue. I tried looking for somebody. I managed to look through multiple environments calling out for friends of mine, even trying to find myself or somebody who could give me an explanation for what was happening to me. This whole scenario was the main reason my trip started to take a turn for the worse as I was too fixated on what I considered a very negative thing. Ego death and becoming water. At some point my ego completely faded away. I was floating in some kind of colorful fractal void and calling out ""who am i"". At first I told myself ""I am Matthew"" but it didn't feel right. It was as if I was saying a name that I had no attachment too. I tried looking at my hands and I couldn't see anything. It was as if I didn't even exist anymore. I tried making sense of this by putting all the information I knew together to form a conclusion. Because I was floating, had no concept of being a person and couldn't see myself I came to the conclusion that I was a body of water. Regaining consciousness and fighting against death. As the peak started to end I managed to see reality again. I could barely see my room as it was overlaid with fractals, but I could make out basic shapes. Each time I blinked I was met with an environment constructed of fractals, though they were immensely beautiful I kept associating them with negativity. I kept trying to regain control of my mind but as I was still tripping it this was next to impossible. My understanding of time itself made no sense. I was unaware of the flow of time and only knew about the present, this stopped me realizing that in time the trip will end and I was convinced the trip would be eternal. This negativity led me to my first panic attack. My only thought was that I was going to die in my bed. I kept fighting against this, and at times I almost gave up before I refused to let death win. After managing to focus and breathe carefully, the panic attack managed to end. The final thought loop. When lying in bed I tried to collect my mind, but as I was still tripping my mind created a thought loop. I can't remember fully what it was about, but I was well aware of it being a thought loop. The issue is, my awareness of the thought loop became part of the loop itself. I tried telling myself to stop looping, but I was immediately met with the loop continuing which eventually went back around to me telling the loop to stop and so on. The loop started to take a nosedive, and negativity started to build up again. This lead to another panic attack. I was shaking and couldn't speak properly. Because of the attack I was convinced that I hard permanently given myself brain damage and was having a seizure (I also thought at times I was having a stroke and a fit). I almost ended up calling an ambulance or getting my parents to help me, but luckily I did not. After about 30 minutes of this, I managed to put some music on and watch YouTube just to force my mind to focus on something else. After a few minutes of this, the panic attack ended, and I managed to calm down. I then managed to get to sleep.

Experience:A combination of 25mg 4-AcO-DMT and unknown amount of 6-APB (benzofury),"Very recently I orally took 4-aco-dmt and benzofury together. I am a beginner to psychedelics in general, as I have only consumed shrooms (about 2.5 grams once) I took one unknown dosage (small amount of benzofury) and 25mgs of 4-aco-DMT ( or what I was told was that amount) I'm going to do things in time so here's the basic jest of what happened. T:00 Substance taken, feeling a little tired from the seminar I took earlier, a little bit nauseous for some reason T:30 starting to feel an adderall like effect, Hands are a bit shaky with a bit of anticipation anxiety T:45 Rush of euphoria starts to hit, alot like a heavy dose of cannabis T:50 I turn on rose by the front bottoms, I lay in bed as I'm feeling a heavy body load T:1:00 I dim the lights in my room from my bed, I give a call to my friend and ask her if she can come over to hang out and trip sit me just incase, I feel the same rush of euphoria wave after wave for the next 25 minutes until I get a heavy feeling in my upper body and notice slight color saturation T:1:25 the full effects kick in at this point, i'm seeing watery reflections and occasional flashes of light in a gelatin-like enviroment. I notice my friend comes over and I tell her how I finally understand why people take psychedelics, I start laughing uncontrollably and start to get a little more nauseous, but it eventually goes away. my friend smokes some cannabis but for some reason this gets me a bit anxious and I start to freak out a bit, she calms me down and I decide to drink some water. The euphoria doesn't come back but i'm still feeling the watery-gelatin effect. Overall this combo can be dangerous in higher dosage and I don't think i'll experiment with aco again, however benzofury definately.

"Experience:Unknown Dosages: 1 psilocin chocolate, 1 hit LSD; Lawing the Mown","Here is how it went on my grand day out with psilocin and LSD on which I operated heavy machinery, smoked cannabis, and operated different heavy machinery. The actual effects were not all that out of the ordinary, but I feel the activities make it worthy of a report. To my chagrin I can't recall the exact day this occurred - it was several months ago - nor can I recall the times of day of any one part of it. I do know that it was a hot summer day and it all occurred before nightfall. At the time my past experience as psychedelics go was with: 25i-nBOME (10 times), psilocin or 4-aco-dmt candies (4 times), psilocybin cubensis (3 times), DMT (1 time (with VERY minimal effects)), mystery acid (1 time), LSD (1 time). It started while I was hanging around and smoking cannabis with my dealer, who was also a sort of friend though I'd not known her long at all, more or less just waiting for greater goods promised to me, which were: 1 psilocin chocolate, 4 tabs lysergic acid diethylamide. Exact measurements are also unknown, unfortunately. I drove her to pick them up, dropped her off, and returned to my house, where I ate the chocolate. It was about the size of a domino. About ten minutes after dosing, I got a call from Dealer Lady asking if I could pick up her and her friend from his trailer park. (Switching to present tense.)I wonder how the heck she got to his trailer park in the first place, but ask no questions, figuring she can't have gotten far in about twenty minutes. I say OK, but I just ate that chocolate, so are you sure I should be driving? No problem, she says, it takes forever to kick in. OK, I say. I drive out to this trailer park across from a gigantic power plant in the middle of nowhere and see her and her friend, and already everything is getting terribly strange. My mouth feels hairy as do my eyes. I think of him as a character from Breaking Bad, Skinny Pete for example, he wears a beanie cap and has really baggy pants and says yo and all that. As I'm driving them back I notice the drugs must be taking hold because I'm experiencing my signature intense embarrassment of everything I do, which always goes on during a psychedelic trip. I'm wearing a beige patchwork hat like one you'd see in Oliver Twist and want desperately to take it off; I also want to turn off the Aphex Twin CD, SYRO, which I have playing. I apologise for the music and Dealer Lady says, don't apologise, we like whatever you like. I think, wow, she kinda knows how I feel. I realize they're really nice people and there's no reason to be afraid when Skinny Pete finds a record under the seat and says, no way Electric Light Orchestra on frickin' vinyl huh. I drop them off and go back to Track 1, ""minipops10[20.2][sourcefield mix]"" and the long endless drive home begins. The song sounds incredible but it also sounds like it's speaking to me, reassuring me as I think about never being able to say no, and it always getting me into trouble. The song tells me, it's going to be OK. And when you get home you can find something to do that will keep ma and pa from figuring something's up. The hairy mouth effect is getting much stronger, my skin feels warm and tingly and stretched, like a taffy skin pulled over a skeleton of rough pumice. My eyes feel really dry and I look ahead at the road, there's rainbow slashes running down it in great arcs and I feel electrical impulses to follow them, barely resisting in order to stay on the road. I wonder why my mind is creating artificial rainbow roads and trying to kill me, only to realize that the other roads are wipemarks on the windshield. Realizing this, I realize also that the wind in my eyes is the AC, and I turn it off. I have immense difficulty keeping my eyes on the road because there's literally an obstacle obstructing my entire field of vision: the windshield. My heart pounds and I feel that electrical singe of intense fear in the face area. After an eternity I reach home. At this point, I'm still living with my parents, so I run into the woods and squat by a brook to smoke some cannabis and take one of the hits of LSD. I also smoke a cigarette if that's important. Later on, I'll lose the other three tabs, and find them by this very brook but rained on and useless, but that's neither here nor there. I return to my yard and find the lawn mower has been set up by my dad and the lawn needs mowing. I grab my iPod, and turn on the album ""Surfing On Sine Waves"" by Polygon Window, then I start the mower. To finish the lawn, I need to mow in four great square spirals turning inwards: Front, Side A, Side B, and Back. I begin with Front. I'm experiencing I'll say Level 4 Geometry at this point. This yard has growing on it what seems myriad trees: a sort of scatter plot of deciduous going from Corner A to Corner C, and a row of coniferous along the road. The coniferous, I reach after about spiral turn four; they're exploding fractalized pain cones, but they're child's play compared to the corners. Going around corners, especially near the woods, but everywhere once I'm going around the trees, is physically impossible to do correctly. I move like a clockwork machine with an organic lifeform inside, straining to turn so that I'll align with the previous row of mowed grass on the unmowed grass, but I physically can't seem to do it. By about turn five I realize that the reason this is is that three sides - along the driveway, along the road, and along the house - are straight lines, but along the woods is a long squiggly line that I seem unable to follow without having to do over again and again. According to the shape of the yard I have to mow in a rhombus with one side irregular, but according to the drugs I have to mow in a perfect square. I unconsciously conform to the shape laid out in my mind, and then consciously conform to the shape of the actual yard, which means mowing takes two or three times longer than usual. However, I've mowed so many times that it's become almost entirely unconscious, yet the exact shape of the yard is not ingrained into my subconscious, and I'm immersed in OEV's at this point which can be quite distracting. This isn't to mention that though I've discovered just what the problem is that's making me have to redo row after row, I'm forgetting, redoing, discovering, and redoing again, ad infinitum. This need for intense focus in a mixed world of perfect geometry versus nature's irregularities makes for one of the most mind-blowing trips I've had. The remainder of the trip is moreorless a repetition of this same problem throughout the entire lawn. I really wish that I could remember - now or even directly after the trip - the thoughts accompanying these, because I can recall a whole lot going on mostly involving the fact that I'm destroying an entire field of tiny living beings that make a habitat for more tiny living beings, thinking about the fact that that's all I do, with bacteria and such, and thinking about the lawnmower as a creature of its own merit, its strange spinning teeth, its cloth belly, its diesel veins, but that's all I've got. It may be fun to find similar, or more importantly quite different, activities to perform, that are unlike the usual for psychedelics, and perform them, either on my own or with some group somewhere.

Experience:5 yopo seeds - Midnight Jungle,"First, I count out five seeds, and put them in a pan, with a low flame. I turn my back for 45 seconds, and they are singed, leaving my entire house smelling like burnt popcorn and peanut butter. After airing out my kitchen, I try again, on an even lower heat, and remain vigilant. One by one, they pop open, and I quickly remove them from the pan. After they have all popped, I remove the matter from the seed shells, and mix all the innards together. I then added a minute amount of lime; I mean Ca(OH)2, not the fruit, that would be silly. The ratio is something like 5:1 yopo to lime. Then a few drops of water, and I mix again. After the paste seems fairly homogenous, I spread it out fairly thin and I let it dry. Start - Once the paste had caked into a powder, I chopped it very finely, and measured out about 100 mg, split into two lines. I have been reticent to insufflate anything recently due to poor experiences this year, but people have been taking yopo this way for millennia, so I figure it's ok. Boy, was I stupid; most likely a function of the lime, there is an incredible burning sensation, but not quite as bad as certain tryptamines I have tried in this way. I feel somewhat lightheaded, I think from adrenaline. 10 min - I don't really feel anything just yet, but the pain is rapidly subsiding. 15 min - Everything is flowing gently, but my room is getting darker, even though it's 4pm in late May. Light appears to reach further without getting brighter. Colors simultaneously stand out more while getting duller; blues and reds stand out to me, but all merge into one shade. 20 min - My carpet has turned into foliage, and my ceiling looks like jungle canopy. I start to laugh because while yopo is from the South American jungles, I am clearly in Vietnam, based on wildlife I see. 30min - 1 hour - This scene maintains itself and it's intensity for sometime, neither increasing or winding down. This trip is unique in that there is 0% symmetrical texture repetition; which for me is a hallmark of a psychedelic experience. I am just purely hallucinating, and this all feels like a lucid yet nonsensical dream. 2 hours - The jungle is all but gone, and I feel awful. I am extremely nauseous, and I am covered in sweat. I feel the urge to take a shower, but my entire body is sore, and I can't easily get up. The room is still very dark though, even though I can see the sun out through my window. It's actually very disturbing. 3 hours I've basically come down by now, with some very gentle flowing once more. I finally get into the shower, and I lose my train of thought multiple times. It probably takes me 30 min. When I manage to get out, I fall right asleep, which is again unusual of a psychedelic in my experience. This was certainly an intriguing and generally positive experience. I am curious to explore bufotenin through other means as well, but this was a decent first time.","['breathing', 'brightness alteration', 'colour replacement', 'drifting', 'external hallucination', 'flowing', 'increased perspiration', 'muscle cramps', 'nausea']",681
Experience:42 mg TMA-6: Pure Bliss,"I wake up around 1pm on a sunday afternoon. I mill around for a bit, have breakfast, then suddenly I realize that I have not tried the TMA-6 I received the other day. A bit of excitement builds, as I remembered how highly Shulgin spoke of this compound in PiHKaL. However, most of my psychedelic experiments in the past 6 months have for some reason caused either my neck to hurt terribly, in a tense sort of way, or my whole body to feel painfully tense. This puts a damper on my attitude towards using more psychedelics, but my curiosity gets the better of me and I decide to go ahead with the trip. 2:00pm I ingest the chemical, then I sit at my desk and begin perusing a science magazine. 2:45pm I am beginning to feel a tingle in my legs and that pleasant feeling one gets in their chest when they are enjoying themselves on a psychedelic (no idea if other people experience this, its a bit hard to explain). 3:15pm I feel energized, and optimistic. Similar to the come-up of MDMA actually. 4:30pm I pace around my kitchen for 10 minutes eating raspberries, thinking of how good of a day it is going to be and how excited I am to tell my friends of my experience. I run out of raspberries, and message my friend M. He gets excited, and this energy seems to rub off on me. I feel positively euphoric at this point. 5:15pm It was probably around here that I started peaking. I do not feel any neck or body tension. This is a pleasant surprise. 6:00pm I begin doing some theoretical work for a project my colleagues and I will begin soon. I get a lot done and enjoy working my mind. 7:00pm I eat a small dinner of french bread and trout. It is delicious, but as usual my appetite is not fully there. Visuals were not all that strong, akin to the visuals of perhaps 180 μg of LSD. Patterns are not as defined as I have experienced with DOC, DOM or DOB, more of just a general color change to a pinkish hue and some morphing upon looking at intricate patterns. Listening to music is just as lovely as you would expect, I experience the typical psychedelic effects on my listening: focusing on small sounds in the backgrounds of songs that I hadn't noticed before, like a second layered vocal tone, or a hi-hat, and just in general having the words to every song come to my mind readily as I listen. 8:45pm I sit outside, the light from the sun almost gone, petting my cat. I feel generally content and satisfied with my current life situation at this point. This generally continues for a few hours until I reach the end of my peak at 11pm. From here, the effects gradually lessen until I fall asleep at 5:30 am. Of course, I have to wake up an hour later to go to work, but I do not feel exhausted or worn out, rather, I feel warm and empathetic. The afterglow felt like the empathetic effects of medium-low dosed MDMA. A positive day, and I have maintained a generally good mood for all the 11 days since I have tried it.

Experience:Unknown dosage - An omniscient sphere,"Regarding mushrooms, the phrase ""A place that feels as if you have entered the very inner workings of the universe, with the underlying source code of existence and the true nature reality presenting itself to you in the most incomprehensible manner"" perfectly captures a state I have entered before, yet had been unable to put into words. In my own experience, it was as if I had dropped into a ""room"" or a space in which I came into contact with an entity-like thing. I can only describe this thing as a giant, all-encompassing, omniscient sphere with which I could interact with in an almost playful manner. I don't recall it every saying anything to me, but I simply felt its presence, and it was the most comforting feeling I have ever reached on a psychedelic. I was the sphere. Interacting with the sphere wasn't me sitting there looking up speaking with it, but more a merging of what I considered ""myself"" to be with it. While listening to a particularly uplifting song, I imagined myself flying through space, on to different solar systems and galaxies, bearing this sound, this beautiful melody, showing other civilizations the happiness humanity is capable of. I was spreading this light, bursting with love and happiness and all that is good about humanity. Conversely, a more negative thought I have had is viewing mankind as an insignificant speck on an infinitesimally small rock on the edge of a random galaxy. I thought about 5 billion years in the future, when our sun will burn up all its energy, and everything we have known and that is important will cease to exist. In addition to these, there was another time in which I felt like I was spiraling down a hole of thought in which I was postulating hypotheses and designing complex yet logical experimental solutions to answer these questions (I am involved in molecular biology, which is probably why these thoughts came up). I eventually came to the conclusion that there was something missing in my evidence, a piece of the puzzle that could not be filled by pure empirical observation. I thought of my bosses at work, and how much I respect them as scientists and how smart they were, but still how they would always fall short of true knowledge with such a limited outlook on life. Of course, I am just some guy who took mushrooms so none of this has any credence other than entertaining musings.

Experience:4.5g - The Grand Introduction to Beauty and Fear,"I was in my bedroom lying down staring at the ceiling while munching on them. My mother was home cooking Ravioli for me, I was reading trip reports to see what I had incoming. I opened the bag and chewed the shrooms as much as I could, I was under the impression i was eating 6 grams but thank god my supplier had subtly ripped me off. First thing I remember happening was my awareness of colors increased tenfold, like weed would do to me but incredibly more intense, I also noticed it was like my vision had been cleared, like glasses but more, it was like I had sudden ""super vision"". I also began feeling this amazing sensation around my body like my skin was coated in this tangy feeling. I looked at my hands and the most amazing moment I describe occurred as I saw my first hallucination, tracers on my hands, my face broke into a massive gaping smile as I moved my hand back and forth in such surprise and amazement at this visual entertainment, it was like my hand was being mass replicated and was following the others in the tightest line imaginable, a full trail of 'hand', similar to raising the trail setting on a cursor on a computer. Then, the ceiling started to move, shifting around and breathing in a sort of way as patterns developed between the stalactite type formations on my ceiling (""popcorn style"" ceiling), they began to mesh together and during all of this I was laughing like crazy, trying to keep silent as I could to not arouse suspicion. The ceiling was now in full motion and I could see full images and moving ""things"" within this ""picture"". It was like a movie on my ceiling, a full fledged motion picture. I was so perplexed by this image that I somehow didn't notice taking my shirt off during it, but I then realized the intense body effects I was feeling, my chest was prickling in pleasure, and I began rubbing my stomach and feeling these tickles of 'awe' throughout my body. I looked out my window (I lived next to a mall at the time) and saw what seems like hundreds of cars outside, which appeared as little multicolored beetle-like insects with this old style 3D-like effect on all of them, the red and blue/green light-slices coming out from either end of all of them, their glowing eyes fixed on this magic trail. Then I saw the trees and the forest next to the mall, and while all this I was listening to Bob Marley's Legend, Jamming was on, and in that moment I looked at the green trees, and to me they became the true idea and concept of ""Jamaica"", this incredible feeling that the spirit of the song and the culture was IN those trees, and more so that those trees just WERE Jamaica. I came to for a moment, and thought about the song, and thought ""Yeah, I really am Jammin', WE'RE JAMMIN'"", and had this amazing moment where I thought about that meaning, the meaning of that term, and was in such a state of peace, and joy. I was just, happy. Then things took a turn for the worse as the song ""Misty Canyon"" came on, its beginning notes putting me off into a strange mood as I frantically tried to change the song, I put it back to jamming but my mood was already changed. I wanted to leave so I decided it would be a good idea to check if my eyes were too big to leave my room. I looked at my reflection and tried to see my eyes but I could not make out my Pupils, then I realized I had two then three, they were bubbling in my eyes and I saw my facial features begin switching with each other and I took one last look at my disfigured face and freaked out. I was terrified for a moment but tried to calm down, I looked at my surroundings and saw my messy clothes on the top rack of my shelf melting into each other like slime, and instantly ripped my vision away from it, trying not to panic. I tied getting back into the peaceful state I was in by looking at the ceiling again, but the picture was gone and all I could see was millions of cryptic numbers falling, like the matrix but different, some kind of coding for reality. During all this the previous physical feelings of pleasure and happiness were replaced by a dark and imposing feeling of strangeness and odd impending doom of some ilk. My body just felt incredibly weird. I had to leave my room so I just did, uncaring of the consequences. I lied down on the couch and felt it trying to suck me in and consume me whole, I tried to ignore the feeling but I felt some kind of nibbling on my toes, but there was nothing I could do, I had to push the feeling away. Then, my mother brought me the Ravioli she had been making me, she asked why i had taken so long and I did a half shrug, tolerantly I had been in there for over two and a half hours and yet, it felt only like a half an hour or less. I tried eating but the ravioli bits felt like my toes in my mouth, like the nibbling was coming from me and I was eating my own toes. I tried forcing down the first one and succeeded but could not consume any more. I needed some form of distraction lest I freak in my living room, so I turned on the movie ""The Incredibles"". I ended up watching it three times without realizing, the strange animation style played with my head even as the shrooms had worn off, the elastic behavior of the arms and the speed of it all was almost too much and the music, had such a profound effect on my mind, every tune changed my literal emotional wellness. Eventually I turned it up and tried going to bed by I was having audial hallucinations still and could not sleep, ever time I lulled a little I would hear this loud speeding 'RIIIIIIIIIIIIING' in both my ears.

Experience:4g - States of unity and interconnectedness,"Unity and interconnectedness with 4 grams of mushrooms + 2 hits from a joint while peaking pretty much shot me out of the universe. It was my first experience with ego loss (not full ego death) and it did bring a great feeling of unity. The only way i could describe it would be to say its like everyone i met and ever will meet shares a part of me and of eachother, and that in the most basic forms everyone is made of the same stuff just shared out across 7 billion people. I found it pretty incredible, particularly the thought that all the good and bad that has been done in the world is something anyone can be capable of and even the most ""evil"" person must share a shred of dignity and understanding with everyone else in the universe.

Experience:3.5g psilocybe cubensis - Relinquishing of Material Chains/Fear and Desolation,"Context: I had never tripped before, unless you include a failed attempt at a 30x salvia trip (will not get into right now), this was my very first experience with psychedelics ever. I didn’t really know what to expect, I had done mild amounts of research but wanted to be surprised. I knew how much was a safe amount and I knew that it would last multiple hours. I bought a quarter of cubensis mushrooms from a reliable source, they were dried and smelled quite disgusting. I measured out 3.5g on a scale and was sent into another dimension of fear facing and love actualisation. T+00 - 01:30: Seeing as I had never really engaged myself in psychedelics before, I wasn’t sure exactly what to expect. The friend who sold them to me had only tried them a couple times and told me that I would experience tracers, melting visuals, and that the world would breathe. He wasn’t very detailed, but it was enough that I had a general idea of what I was walking into. He told me it was a big commitment, seven hours at the most he said. I ate them raw, but would fill my mouth with some Arizona iced tea to aid the disgusting aroma and texture that the mushrooms had. I almost vomited while trying to eat them. I was sitting at my computer on TinyChat with some friends, they enjoyed watching me eat them I think. I waited about 20 minutes and then I smoked a bowl, hoping it would help with the sudden alteration in my bodily sensations. The first thing I noticed was this kind of writhing feeling, like all my cells were moving around in my body and like I could feel every little micromovement they made. At first this was unsettling, but as I settled into the experience I became more comfortable with it. I got up to use the restroom, at this point I hadn’t noticed any changes in the external world, only in my body, and when I got into my robin’s egg blue bathroom I noticed that the normal textures of my walls were different. They were sort of drifting and swirling around, at this point I was getting very excited because up until then I had been very skeptical about the “visuals” that people talk about with psychedelics. I had thought that, of course, most of them would simply be implied and that if I stared at them long enough they would simply go away. Peeing was very difficult, my bladder was full but it took me a great amount of effort to get my urine out. After I was finished I turned around to see my mirror, and my reflection. I stopped immediately, that wasn’t me in the mirror, was it? No, couldn’t be, it didn’t look like me, but at the same time the person I was staring at shared all of my physical characteristics. I stood there for a few minutes, mesmerized at how this strange person was staring back at me through this glass rectangle. When he moved, I moved, I knew that he was me, but it didn’t look right, he looked too real. I realized that I could not distinguish between myself and the reflection, it looked to be too much in the same plane of existence as I was. I got myself out of the bathroom, [Tiffany] (a friend) had warned me about staring into the mirror before I ingested, so I decided it was probably for the best. I didn’t feel frightened by this new me, only confused. How did he get into my bathroom? Why couldn’t I touch him? I moved on, sat back down in my chair, turned on some Tycho and smoked another bowl, which settled out my crawling bones and flesh under my skin. My head started to feel light, at around T+1:00 I decided that I needed to get out of my place, the walls were breathing and everything was sort of swimming, I looked at my table and it was bending and bulging around in ways that a normal coffee table was definitely not supposed to do. I got my phone, keys, knife, whatever, put my headphones on, and opened up the door into the screaming outside. T+1:30 - 5:50: When I stepped foot out the door the world was immediately changed. The houses before me were swinging and moving with the breeze, rising and falling, incredibly saturated, the sky emanated a gorgeous purple hue as the sun began to set behind the slowly drifting clouds. Cars whizzed by, leaving tracers far behind them, at the time I called these “trails of energy,” I believed that I could sense the movements of the universe, that I was now in the ethereal pull and push of the great expanding everything. My body felt as though it were rooted to the ground, melding and swirling with the concrete under my feet, but my head was somewhere else entirely. It seemed to me that my head was at least two feet above my body, that my eyes were higher, I could not really feel myself doing physical things. I turned to face the direction of the park, where I knew that I must go, for that was where I would find the beauty I so desired to consume. While walking, I couldn’t feel myself moving, I just thought about walking and my body moved perfectly, effortlessly. I realized where I was, what I was doing, and how incredible it felt and I got a wave of incredible euphoria up my spine. Now sure of what I must do, that I must use this power that I had been granted to discover the darkness in me, I made my way to the park. The world was highly saturated, color shifts were mildly apparent in the houses and flowers, which looked to be alive and dancing in the wind. When I reached the park I walked slowly around trees, they looked as though they had faces, young and old. Full of thousands of emotions and years of wisdom, they towered over my reeling form, breathed life into my confused mind. They were beautiful and mesmerizing. I stepped through this dark and brooding forest, filled with beams of light and slight fractals, my vision was highly improved, everything looked far more detailed than it had previously. I went through the gazebo and sat down at the fountain, watching the trees breathe and sway, music pumping through my body. At this point I felt an immense sense of love and compassion for the world around me, thoughts careening through my head, I could pick out any thought process I wanted to and expand or contract it as much as I pleased. I realized that the majesty of nature was unsurpassed by any other sight on the planet, that this, this was perfection. I started texting [Mel], telling her I hoped that she could see how magical the world was, that she could feel the love and wonder that I felt. Behind me a homeless man was standing on one of the concrete platforms around the edge of the fountain, shouting some nonsense, but I couldn’t hear him. I sat there for a while and just watched the world move, completely bamboozled by how everything felt and looked. I kept thinking that I wanted more, it wasn’t enough, even though it was insane, I knew that I was still too grounded for my liking. I walked about the rose garden, staring at all the dancing flowers. It suddenly occurred to me that I still wanted more closeness with the galaxies, that whatever I was or wherever I was wasn’t enough. I was compelled to eat part of a rose that I held in my hand, it fluttered around and breathed and sighed and laughed, enticing me to devour it and join it in its togetherness with the universe. I ate three of its petals slowly, lovingly, they didn’t taste like anything noticeable, after I was eating them I was really confused and started laughing at how fucking ridiculous it was that I was eating flowers. I got up and left the rose garden. Upon reaching the street, I wasn’t sure which way to go. I was met with a large greyhound and its owner, who was checking their phone. I stared at the dog and cocked my head to one side, thinking Which way should I go? It looked at me for a moment, turned its head from right to left to look at both directions, and then nodded to my right with a bark. I nodded and thought Thank you, wise one. The dog simply barked again and I went on my merry way. I started laughing again because I could not believe that I just took directions from a dog. What was I even doing with my life? While walking down the street I was infinitely interested in all things around me, nothing was boring, the whole world teemed with immeasurably fascinating organisms, all which contained information that I could not possibly understand, but that I wanted to anyway. I was strolling down a neighborhood street, I wasn’t very far from home, maybe a mile and a half, and the friend that sold them to me called me. I picked up, he asked me how I was doing, I said I was absolutely splendid. He asked if I had taken them and I replied in the affirmative, I told him that while I was walking I had decided that I didn’t need to be so caught up in material wealth, that all these “things” I “needed” were meaningless, that I shouldn’t be frustrated with the way things are incomplete because my life is still changing, I am still changing, I told him that I’ve decided to be less rushed in my approach, that I need to focus on learning how to love myself and my fellow man, that I was done whining and worrying about petty things that meant absolutely nothing. He was a bit confused and just told me that those were good things to realize. He started to talk but then I told him that I must go, I had important matters to attend to. I walked back to the park, sat on the swings for a bit, it was very fun to swing. I thought about all the aspects of my life, who I was, where I was, what I was, when I was. I decided I was still in a transition period, that I shouldn’t be taking life so seriously, that I needed to take a step back and try to find my place in the world before rushing into anything serious. After a bit of time swinging, it was starting to get dark, so I went home. I was very excited about all the wonderful things I was thinking, I wanted to share it with people, I wanted to share this beautiful experience with someone. My neighbor was a safe place, usually, I knocked on his door, eager to tell him all of my new thoughts. He opened the door, and immediately everything was wrong. His apartment looked different, furniture had been moved around, I got a flood of bad vibes and negative emotions, his face was wet with saline, he looked years older, lifetimes of hardships etched along the laugh lines, the furrowed brow. He told me that he was going through a difficult time and that he was going to try to stay cool, I was freaked out and told him I was sorry and that I had to go, that I didn’t realize I was intruding, I apologized again and fled into my apartment. I was terrified, horrified, everything was wrong, everything was different, I felt like I was intruding on the world, like I saw something I wasn’t supposed to see. I paced around my apartment, which now felt oppressive, so I decided I would get up and leave again to face my fears and darkness that was flooding my brain. I stepped out into the now pitch city, walked to the park again, stood under trees and thought about all the danger and darkness in my life. I faced my fear of blackness and emptiness, the creaking forest unsafe, but I had placed myself there and slowly adjusted to the sense of urgency and danger. After staying there for a bit I felt a surge of pain and discomfort up my body, like the poison was taking some new toll, upon feeling this immense physical discomfort I realised that I needed to return home, my body was warning me that I was about to fall back down to Earth from the stratosphere, and I wanted to be in a safe place for this to happen. While walking back I saw an old man pushing a shopping cart with what looked like a child and a white dog in it. He stopped at the corner, took the dog out, left the baby, and walked down the street. I was far in front of him and very frightened at this point so I decided just to leave it. I quickened my pace and finally reached my home. It still didn’t feel right, nothing felt right. I sat down on the couch and tried to watch Jeff, Who Lives at Home, a movie that has (in the past) made me feel good, but it didn’t exactly work. T+6:00 - 9:30: Most of this is a blur, I just sat at my computer on Skype talking to my friends and smoking bowl after bowl. I ate most of my leftovers from the previous night, but I didn’t enjoy eating them. They felt weird, my body still felt weird, but most of the visuals had disappeared by this point. I told them all about my experience and what had happened, they kept me awake and I felt better after I had talked for a good two hours. Once I was finished with the Skype call and I felt safe enough to go back to bed, I showered, got undressed, and slipped into the sheets. They felt physically awesome, but I was still emotionally uncomfortable, the world felt oppressive, so I just tried to think about all the good things I had learned as I drifted off to sleep.

"Experience:3 Grams of Mushrooms - Reset on my Life, Experiencing Satori and the Cosmic Perspective","For me after this experience nothing was ever the same again. Life was completely different and even though I felt I was given many answers I am only left with a million more questions. It taught me that knowing more really is knowing less or being aware that you never knew anything and still know nothing and never will during this ""human trip"". I had done a small dose of mushrooms (0.7 grams) the day before mixed with 2 tabs of some RC that was sold to me as ""acid"" but this day I just ate the mushrooms. I had 3 grams on an empty stomach at 8 a.m. in the morning (which is all I had left) and expected just to ""trip balls"". Well....I wouldn't exactly call it 'tripping balls' but I went through an experience that was utterly alien/non-physical and extremely dynamic, an emotional journey into nothingness and into..everythingness? All at the same time or at least on the same journey I don't know it's so hard to remember. It started off just really strange, usual anxious shroom come up and I was looking at this lantern that I had in my room that had some cool pattern engravings and I ""saw"" this strange very eerie etheric ""energy"" or something sort of wafting through and around the patterns and over the course of the next 2 to 2 1/2 hours I honestly have no idea what happened and I can't remember. It felt like I was juts blasted out; just felt like I went to the furthest corners of the most alien dimensions and realms (mental not visually) and I just remember it being like the tourist ride into hyperspace and higher dimensions. Everything about it felt predetermined and deep. I feel like what happened during that 2 hour period I'm not even ""allowed"" to remember or bring back what happened there or what I saw/experienced. I never expected such a dramatic almost salvational, hortatory experience to come out of only 3 grams of mushrooms. Wasn't even a big dose but they were great quality. Anyways I can't remember much from these first few hours all I can really say is I was sitting there in my living room (no longer in my room) watching television (which I never do) because I can't think of anything else to do other than to just sit there. I can't just listen to music because I don't want to deal with it and I can't just use my computer because I don't want to move a lot and do a lot of actions so I just sit and watch T.V. and just get tripped the fuck out by shows and movies and commercials I had never heard of or seen before. But those first 2 hours it felt like my consciousness had transcended to another dimension and my body didn't matter, things were still clearing up. After this came the peak which is when I really start to remember these things. During the peak I was just sitting watching this commercial and it was this beauty product commercial I guess and time was slowed down and things started to just 'make sense'. Everything started to make sense. It felt like the first 2 hours all the pieces of everything had been taken apart and now they were being put back to together. It was like those first 2 hours was just spent crushing every paradigm I had and completely invalidated every laid down model of reality I thought I had in my head. Never before had my previously laid down models of reality been more up for debate then during this experience. It's almost like the trip had to crush all my ideas and preconceptions about reality so that it could get me ready for what it was going to show me. It had to dress me up before taking me out. So time is slowed down, this lady from the commercial is looking at me and this is when this were REALLY visual and things were really HD and hyperreal. Incredibly hyperreal and things started to seem very emotional and eternal and felt like coming home. It was so strange yet felt so familiar. Her face looked huge but in a beautiful way and looked like she was popping out at the T.V. She looked like she was coming out of some other dimension and the borders of this dimension were spinning and they looked brightly colored, vibrant luminous Aztec or Mayan patterns that looked like they were drawn by Simon Haiduk. The looked quite organic and solid, extremely intricate too if I really looked close and there was hexagons all around like this geometric netting. Emotionally or mentally and little bit visually it felt like she wanted to ""take me deeper""? Whatever that means, if was like she wanted to pull me into this other dimension and she looked very luring about it and almost sexual...in a way...like licentious. It was strange and very other worldly. It looked like she was from spiritual hyperspace or some kind of tryptamine dream dimension. My T.V. or living room felt like the epicenter of this organic dream matrix. The mushrooms were speaking to me in a very pithy way with strong intent through deep emotion and the woman's facial expressions like a pantomimic show. She told me (emotional/mentally) that humans know nothing. She was like ""We have shown you so many things today, things you cannot imagine now do you really think after all of this that humans really know what the hell is going on?"" It made the current human understanding and comprehension look so foolish and so restricted by so many things relating to biology. I also had to feel the sufferings of humanity at one point and go super emotional but the mushrooms in the end rewarded me. They actually LIKED the fact that I was torn up about and feeling compassionate about the sufferings of humanity. It then gave me incredible euphoria better than the best ecstasy. It was like God's ecstasy it was amazing and I saw sacred faces on all surfaces. After the ""blast"" though (the first 2/3 hours of the trip) it felt like I had gone somewhere else and had become part of that and knowing that and so when I came back here it was like ""wtf"".. Because that reality I went to or higher dimension I went to feels more real than this. It was like my consciousness went from 4 dimensional reality back down to 3 dimensional reality but was having trouble coming back. It felt lie coming back down to earth and literally felt like I had to ""relearn"" everything in the dimension and I was able to reevaluate everything but from this comic almost esoteric perspective. A timeless perspective. Life has never been the same. It showed me anything is possible and every weird or incredible made up sounding thing I've heard since then that has turned out to be real..none of it surprises me anymore because I know any and all things are possible and many of them have already happened.

Experience:3g - I found god inside of myself,"(+0:00) 3 grams of mushrooms taken orally at 1:30 pm alone. (+0:18) I am beginning to feel the coming up anxiety. (+0:22) Body discomfort is apparent, though there is very little nausea. (+0:26) Shivers take over my entire body. I feel extremely cold and blankets do not relieve the terrible coldness I feel going through my entire body. (+0:36) My bones feel very good to move. My body feels a bit better and I have less anxiety. (+0:43) Just so cold. (+0:49) Feeling much better, I have tons of energy. I am now going outside. I proceeded to walk outside and become one with the music, but for some reason, something did not feel right. I was tripping yet it felt so different from my previous trips. My mind felt like it was overwhelmed with anxiety. I decided to head back inside to fight my subconscious. What ensued was utter madness. My mind was in chaos and slowly, over the next hour, I put it back together. At some point, self-hatred, anxiety, and self-doubt ceased to become logical. When you have seen what I have seen, there can be no room for self-doubt. There can be no room for fear. I once again felt compassion and love for myself and along with that, compassion and love for all of humanity. I cannot fully describe the events that took place, but after an hour, I had both won and lost the battle. I grieved for the I who had lost and cheered for the I who had won. I still have issues to work out, but I had fought enough for today. I knew without a doubt, that I am capable of overcoming all of my struggles, personal problems, and emotional baggage. The journey will not be easy, but it is something that I have to do. I closed the door to the apartment, mentally visualizing it as the door to the dark parts of my subconscious and walked outside to the light of my mind. As soon as I walked outside, I began tripping balls. Really tripping balls. My perspective was not completely clouded with culture, drama, and meaningless problems. The beauty of my existence, my loved ones, and my position in the universe were finally put into perspective. I experienced rapidly fired thoughts, euphoria, and visuals. I wrote in my notebook: I have found god. I have found all of the answers of suffering. The answers are inside myself. I am god. Tripping allows you to see inside the control panel of your mind. Beyond all the daily annoyances (your inner life) there is the answer. There is god. God is inside of you. All you must do is close the door on what has made you “you” and endless possibilities await you. The answers are inside you. I cannot communicate with language what I have felt, I can only communicate with music. I have found god. I am god. God is everywhere. God is in everyone. We are all god, but only few realize it. I spent the rest of my trip walking outside. I walked for 6 hours straight and never got tired, listening to Shpongle and Bluetech. The universe whispered to me its secrets. I have forgotten most of them, but even now, I feel them inside of me. I may only have direct access while I am tripping, but I know that it is always there inside of me.

Experience:2.5g Psilocybe Cubensis B+ strain - epiphany of nondualistic reality,"After about 40 minutes I could start feeling the effect. Initially it was just a spatial distortion. I realized that I had never listened to music in this way before. The instruments had an incredible clarity and I was hearing things I felt I wouldn't normally notice. But it was more than that: each piece (which was instrumental) was as if it had its own narrative and even the individual instruments were like ""teachers"" in the music. Each piece had its own personality and set of lessons. After sitting in the comfy chair for a bit I started feeling a bit uncomfortable, like breathing was weird. The rational part of my mind told me to ignore that because I knew I could breathe fine, but I wanted to feel more comfortable so I went to my bed and hugged a pillow as I kept listening to the music. The music was everything and I had some closed-eye visual effects, mostly random patterns. But sometimes I saw faces in the darkness (they were ephemeral and indistinct, barely dreamlike). One of these faces was a being. It was Death. I said that I wasn't afraid of Death. But the answer was that I SHOULD be afraid of it. And that the fear could be a strength. That it was normal. That I shouldn't pretend not to fear it, that it is completely human. It told me I should be careful about doing things that are self-destructive or overly dangerous. I knew I had been drinking a bit much recently. I asked why. Something told me that it was because I wanted to dampen the world, I was feeling overwhelmed, and I wasn't finding the beauty that was present in every moment. I knew this communication was from my own subconscious. It told me not to take everything I'm everything too seriously. This personification of my own subconscious seemed to be simultaneously pragmatic but also not too full of itself. Subject matter continued to evolve as I listened to the music which was indescribably profound. After one of the pieces of music the audience cheered. The cheering seemed to last forever and ever. A thought in my head was ""it is not about the celebration."" For a moment I resented that the cheering/celebration was interrupting the music. But then an additional thought was ""but it is ALSO about the celebration."" The thought occurred to me that the celebration which was the connection of our shared humanity was also important. I started thinking in metaphors. The musical instruments were metaphors. It was like I could understand the intention and feelings the musicians brought to the pieces. I was experiencing metaphors all around me. Another idea came to me: that the world is not about opposites. We are not in a dualistic universe. What some people call ""cognitive dissonance"" is not about containing opposite ideas, but compatible ideas. In my mind I called this ""concurrent realities."" I knew that if I could see more things as a whole, with these concurrent realities all together, it would be a powerful way to understand existence. I went back to my comfy chair. I removed my eyeshades. Over the bed in my bedroom is a painting. I saw it in a new way that I never had before; the painting is of a scene from the desert with standing rocks and a picture of the moon on one side and the sun on the other. But when I looked at it, it seemed as if the foreground rocks stood out from the background in a way I had never noticed before, like their edges were stronger and more three-dimensional. I saw faces in the rocks. And the clouds/sky over them in the image seemed to flow very subtly. But this is the important part... the visual weirdness wasn't what was important. I could see the painting as a metaphor. It was the non-dual ""concurrent realities"" idea again -- the sun and moon together were not opposites, they both exist simultaneously. I continued to think about concurrent realities for a while. Thoughts of Death again: that Death is to be feared. And also NOT to be feared. It was another concurrent reality. The visual effects seemed to tone down after a couple hours. I made a cup of coffee and for the rest of the time I felt a bit discombobulated and slightly euphoric but the deep experience was past. Later that night I had dinner and poured one glass of wine. I drank it, trying to connect with it and be in the moment with it. Normally I'd drink half a bottle (at least) but only felt like drinking the one. I felt like I was appreciating it in a new way.","['conceptual thinking', 'depth perception distortions', 'flowing', 'increased music appreciation', 'internal hallucinations', 'introspection', 'pattern recognition enhancement', 'perception of interdependent opposite', 'thought connectivity', 'thought organization', 'unity and interconnectedness']",956
Experience:2.5g - Swim's first mushroom trip,"So it was the twenty-eighth day of the twelve month of the year which a majority of the people in my time period on Earth label with the number two-thousand and twelve when I ingested dried mushrooms which contained an illegal psychedelic compound known as psilocybin for the first time. I was in the company of my companion who is dear to my heart and who I label as the closest of my friends. He was more experienced with psilocybin, and had also ingested at other points in time the chemical known as lysergic acid diethylamide. As he was both experienced with the act of mind-alteration via the use of substances while at the same time being another conscious entity with which I hold much meta-cognitive dissonance, I was fairly comfortable with my choice of consuming what may have been roughly two-point-five to three grams of dried psychoactive fungi. Expectations were something I nearly lacked in all entirety. It was to be the first psychedelic experience I would have beyond large hits of cannabis derived oil. There was this idea in my head that I may see things like colors that should not regularly be seen given the circumstances had the circumstances not involved a foreign thing acting upon my neuro-transmitters. While this was as much an idea in my head at the time as these words being read are an idea in my head now at the time of writing, it was also true that I was skeptical of these thoughts considering that if there are things within the confines of this universe which are truly only understood once experienced, a psychedelic experience is one of those things. The psychedelic experience as a generalization was, for me at the time, understood to this extent without any such experience prior. And so I could only narrowly guess that certain things may be perceived to me, such as odd colors or some form of spontaneous enlightenment regarding reality that may or may not persist longer than the neurological effect of the psilocybin upon my mind. I did not expect these happenings to be happenings that would happen- instead I was very anxious to experience something for which I would know and recognize as rather unexplainable without extreme extrapolation on the many things the experience is not which someone being informed of the experience must rely on if they had never experienced such a thing. Without experience, I believed already that the experience would be something to escape the grasp of laymen’s terms as if it were a highly technologically advanced space vessel traveling past the Earth of ordinary perspective close to the speed of light. Indeed, I currently believe that the psychedelic experience is something which transcends typical explanation because everything within it is only vaguely relatable to what most sober hominoids would consider to be reality. Reality seems like the only thing that is actually the same between being sober and being under the influence of something that does not send you past reality- which some things do, but which I’ve yet to experience. Provided you are aware of what reality is, your physical set and setting will never change- only be distorted upon, or your perceptions of it drastically altered by that fact that your psyche is being vigorously twisted by the will of the molecular bounds between a substance of the correct chemical composition and the neurological chemicals within your brain which, alongside the neuro-electrical aspects of consciousness, are the very thing which generate your thoughts through their sheer interconnected complexity. When the effects of substances are typically analyzed, the categories are often that of the mind and that of the body- what a drug user feels as a “head high” and a “body high”. A head high may be slowed or extremely fast thoughts, or creativity. A body high may be a feeling of extreme relaxation or of feeling so heavy that one can only reach for the cheetos in vain as your buddy takes the remote and moves it somewhere you are far too lazy to go for, leaving you to your fate of lethargically observing a documentary on the television relating to lions that roam the Great Australian Outback, having you contemplate the mindset of an aboriginal warrior consuming drugs before going to face these lions in unarmed combat. I cannot describe the fashion in which I thought while I was under the influence of mushrooms at that time. Partially because meta-cognition is something very abstract and which takes much effort to fully explain in itself while sober, but mostly because it has been so long since I have been in a psilocybin-influenced state-of-consciousness. However, I can say that it did things to aspects of my personality, or perhaps simply my energy levels and impact of positive things upon me. Once the effects were verily upon me, I was hyper. I was energetic and almost indescribably happy. But before this, I was simply… Content. Eager to learn what this whole mushroom yibbity yabbity was really all about. My friend and I talked, I knew I was going to have mushrooms with him- with him not only in the sense that I would be under the influence of mushrooms and also under the influence of him, but that I would be under the influence of mushrooms while he is also under the influence of mushrooms. I don’t remember what we talked about. We put our portions of manna into containers meant for drinkable liquid and then doused them in lemon juice. The purpose of the lemon juice is for it to pre-convert the psilocybin in the mushrooms into psilocin so that ones body does not have to- the result is that the drugs hit you faster, harder, and for a shorter duration. In other terms, the effects of the sacrament are condensed because you are not actively converting the main psychoactive and instead it goes into your system more at once. Actually, I believe mine was in a brown bowl. It’s rather funny how memory can work like that- I’ve put my mushrooms and lemon juice in a glass on other occasions, and so it led me to think of my first experience in this same fashion- but the reality seems more likely to be that it was a bowl now that I am writing of the experience. Through the tool of language, I symbolically asked the mushrooms and/or the universe of a couple of things. I asked primarily of for information or some form of enlightenment- I knew that I very much wished to take something out of my five-hour trip that I could keep within my mind that would overall impact my life in a positive fashion and to also retain whatever this abstraction could be. Happiness was another thing I asked of. I also requested that, while it was not my primary reason for the ingestion of the mushrooms, that some level of fun be had on my trip- if the mushrooms saw it as something fitting. A bad trip was not something that I think I considered. Jumping out of a window due to perceiving large worm creatures was not something I would expect to occur, either. No, jumping out of windows seemed very much like something to occur with a drug like Salvia Divinorum instead of mushrooms. I did not have a bad trip, and sadness was not a part of my experience in any way. Before I gulped down my bitter, sour soup of lemon extract and dried mushrooms, my mind was very clear. I had a laptop with me- and now that I think about it, that date was but a few days after Christmas, when I was gifted the laptop I am typing on at this moment. Indeed, this laptop and the laptop beside me during my first mushroom trip are one and the same. There was an internet connection which I used to contact those with which I held a relationship with online. In particular, I contacted privately a man who lives in Australia. He is a homosexual man and he, at the time, wrote computer programs in the python programming language as a hobby. He is a man that myself and my companion gave the label “That gay Australian python programmer” for when we refer to him. He was given information from me through the internet that I had just eaten mushrooms, and I asked if he had ever done such a thing. He had not, but he allowed me to passively talk to him as I prepared for the psilocybin to hit me. I sat down in a comfortable chair after both me and my buddy had our drugs. The first thing that I noticed was that the walls began to breathe. Ecstatic emotion shivered down my body as I realized that the mushrooms were doing things to me. My fingers typed messages to my gay Australian programmer friend and my mouth let out words to inform my friend of what was happening. At first I had to make sure that the wall movement was not some form of a placebo, but soon I was verily convinced that it was really the work of what I had put into my body. Very interesting- how eating something can make the walls seem to move in such a fashion. The more I observed, the more sure I was that this was definitely an effect of the mushrooms. So far so good. The mushrooms had given me something easy for me to describe and easy for a sober person to imagine- it was much like the result of optical illusions, like when one sees a spiral for long enough and then looks at a surface only to note that there were still odd movements. The breathing of the walls was definitely a subtle and more stereotypical thing to expect of hallucinogenic drug use. It was something I would have expected. My knees unbent and my legs ceased to be limp as I got up. I moved about to see how I was adapting to this changing state of mind. Not too far from this moment did I notice something far less easy to describe. When I looked over to the wall opposite my friends door I witnessed a beautiful transformation of color which requires an understanding of what the wall looks like without the aid of drugs. It also serves as a rather touching story. When he was a child, his mother wanted to paint something for him on that wall- I forgot what it was, and so I just asked him. “A pond, which would have had frogs.” is the information he exchanged to me when prompted. So the wall was to be a pond, and she used a sponge to paint it. Eventually, his mother came to believe that she wasn’t a good enough artist to accomplish the task, and she was very emotionally impacted by the thought. As the emotions had brought her to some degree of tears, he told her encouragingly that what she painted looked like beautiful mountains. She composed herself and added red stars atop the mountains. As a result of that event, his wall had reddish brown triangles coming from the bottom composed of sponge-squares. You know that sponge-texture, right? Imagine that, especially at the edges of the color, there were holes where the wall was untouched by the paint with the same degree of holes upon the otherwise solid flat surface of a sponge- because that’s what it was. Above the mountains was light-blue sky, also composed of the same sponge-texture. The texture was undoubtedly beautiful. As a result of my choice to partake of a psychedelic, his wall appeared to be fucking holographic. You know those holographic cards and such that could be used to form animations, right? Imagine that, especially at the edges of the color, everything was shifting in a fashion that was as if it was animated but at the same time not diverting too far from what it really looked like- because that’s what it looked like to me. The effect was absolutely astounding. My eyes admired it for the moment when I first came across the effect. It was very alien from anything I could have imagined the mushrooms doing to my visual perceptions. The breathing walls were so simplistic- and then I was hit with this. At the same time, perhaps the odd cognitive effects of the mushrooms had taken hold of me. I looked around the area of color shifting- my friend had a bunk bed against that wall with the lower bunk missing. In its place was a table used as a desk with his laptop on it. My eyes scanned that area for signs that the laptop or some other light source could possibly be shining on the wall in a way that I was not consciously aware of. There were no foreign sources of light. My focus shifted back to his wall. I was heavily awestruck by the experience. I conversed with my friend regarding what I was witnessing. My body fell back into the comfortable chair. The conversation between me and my friend somehow turned into him talking about the fashion in which I am a unique individual. He stated how I am likely to exit the universe simply because of the degree to which I am unlike other conscious entities. I allowed a distinct effect of the mushrooms upon my body to be become more pronounced- it was an odd sensation felt all around in conjunction with my highly elevated mood. As I was being informed of my form of individuality, my informant began making hand motions around me. With his language explaining my escape from the universe and his fluid hand motions, my friend gave me the impression that I had indeed been separated from the rest of space or space-time somehow. It was as if there were a thin layer around me like either a force-field or space warping just outside my skin as to enclose me in a personal bubble disconnected from everything else. Of course, I didn’t believe in my mind that I was anywhere other than the chair in a room on planet Earth. Shortly after, we trekked into the hallway outside and then into the bathroom adjacent his bedroom. Again, the alterations of psilocybin upon my visual field had left me in a state of complete amazement. Time has not treated my memory of the event kindly, but I like to believe that simply entering the bathroom let into another reality. I was aware of where I was, who I was, and why I wasn’t quite how I would normally have been. I also knew the properties of the wallpaper in the room did not account for their gracious shape-shifting appearance. Once the experience is analyzed, it does seem that the wallpaper of the bathroom and sponge-painted mountains of the bedroom were very similar. For the bedroom, it was a beautiful shifting of the colors because of the texture. For the bathroom, it was an astonishing shifting of the repeating flower patterns which seemed due to their prominence and repetition around the room. The mountains were a wall to be looked at in awe- but the wallpaper surrounded the bathroom and encompassed my friend and I. The atmosphere was joyous and speckled with a rather indescribable feeling- Most typically experienced emotions are very charged in descriptions, but at the same time relatable for a majority of people. But while influenced by mushrooms, there are feelings which can be somewhat explained, but at the same time are not just normal emotions extrapolated- they can be something completely alien, as if the spectrum of emotion has been given a new dimension. And so I was joyous, but at the same time I was energized and filled with a feeling that can only be described as “I am on mushrooms experiencing a new form of consciousness for the first time and I’m in this bathroom and the walls are currently one of, if not the most beautiful things I have ever witnessed.”- because everything we describe in our experiences is relative to everything else because the rest of reality is our medium for comparison- and even though it was a feeling or a sensation of the overall setting or atmosphere of this trip, it was completely incomparable to anything else. After some discussion with my buddy about the properties of the wallpaper, we ended up sitting in his bathtub. There are two doors in his bathroom on opposite walls, I sat in the tub on the side with the door which we did not enter the room from, and so my amigo was to the left of me. My fingers traced all along the wet shower-head which was dangling down to my side as the man beside me playfully strummed his electric guitar. It sported a rather unprofessional paint job and was not plugged in- but neither of these things were seen as negative. My body was in a blissful laze, my eyes transfixed on the flowers laid flat against the wall as they were morphing in and out of position. Once I had my strange fix of caressing my friends bathing apparatus, I had to jokingly inform him that I no longer approved of him giving me drugs that would make me feel up his gross shower. We laughed and I came to a realization. “We’re on mushrooms sitting inside an empty bathtub. I’m feeling the shower-head and you’re playing a guitar that isn’t even plugged in.”, I paused. “This is EXACTLY what the right-wing conservative Christians think us liberal drug users are doing!”, we shared another hearty laugh. Eventually I tore my hand permanently from its eerily sensual attraction to my friends shower head before we returned to his room. There was a song I once heard in the past that I dearly wanted to find once again. I hopped on the laptop of my friend to discover a new song- the same which I’m listening to at this moment. The Pot by Tool. To this day this song is very special to us. This is when we busted out the paint. My friend had an interesting ritual of putting art around his walls while under the influence of substances. And so we designated portions of the wall for ourselves. My fingers dipped into the paint. I flicked. Woh. I spoke his name- “I understand splatter art now!”, he chuckled and I flicked more green paint over his large pencil-drawn pac-man. We talked about art that is called art for the sake of art and made fun of a subculture known as hipsterism. Some of my paint went over into a larger area than I was intended to cover and he told me that I had done enough art for the moment, so as to stop us from going too far. I understood well enough and refrained myself from turning his entire wall into splatter art. In reality, the green paint didn’t cover too much, but it was over some of the other art on his wall. During this time I was constantly going back and forth between the bathroom and the bedroom. Before I went into the bathroom alone, my friend told me not to get too engrossed in there and made sure I was in a good state of mind. The first time I went I stayed in there for quite a bit. It’s hard to say how long, because I didn’t look at time much like a sober person would. Especially when I was alone did the idea of time seem less and less applicable to anything. When I was in the bathroom, it was my private time alone with the effects of the mushrooms. At one point I looked into the mirror for a long period of time and I saw the distortions upon my facial features. To me, all these constant shifts in my appearance were like different paths in the future that I could take that would subtly impact how my face would turn out. They were all different possible realities for me to choose from. There were knocks at the door. “You doing alright in there?”, “Yeah.”, I opened the door and I believe I went directly back into the bedroom. But my friend believes with a certain level of clarity that this was actually when we sat in the tub. Alright, we just concluded that we sat in the bathtub on two occasions. So after that I would return to the bathroom for my private time every once and awhile, but that was likely the longest time I spent in there. It was nice going between the two settings- I would be with my buddy and we would be very connected and synchronously working on the other like a form of perpetual motion applied to our communication and exchange of information. We are so alike cognitively that is as if there is no neurological friction between our brains. We fluently understand eachothers mental models and very pathways of thought that when sober, we spiral into a form of informational singularity where we both say “We know exactly how this conversation will progress from this point.”. When we are high on marijuana it is even more grand. At this moment though, we were both under the influence of beautiful psilocybin- and the result was an unexplainable connection between two human beings. I put on the album “If” by Mindless Self Indulgence and painted on the small piece of wall between his door frame and closet. The result was a tree with blood and mycelium like things as its roots, and in the middle was the word “If”. Straight red lines and white organics beneath the tree on the left and right were meant to be contrasts to one another- at the same time that I painting this, I remember imagining the tree in different frames, as if it were a part of a film reel. Something were there in my consciousness regarding a non-traditional interpretation of time. Whatever the specifics of the thought were have escaped my memory through the course of the same concept which I contemplated. Small shifts were noticed in my art as I slowly crafted it into material existence against the surface of the wall- minute little phases similar to the magnificence of the sponge-mountains when I first observed them. In terms of magnitude of course, it was less than a moderate effect. Cognitive effects had been reduced to only a glowing feeling and a surplus of happiness. Throughout the experience there were heights of more extreme cognitive shifts- such as when my friend was on the phone. The thought process and change in the very form of thinking is currently too lost in time for decent retrospection, let alone description- as such the “feelings” are what I have described. Needless to say. there were little to no cognitive shifts left over that are not accounted for by a generalized happiness and excitement when me and my friend left the house for a walk, and if there were any more visual ones then it was only that everything was a bit brighter. Happiness was definately not only a highlight of the mushroom trip, but also something I took from it- I understood that there were things I couldn’t control, yet happiness was still possible. Not only was it still possible, but happiness was something I should make a goal of for myself. Passively during the trip, I thought about my ex, whom I was still highly attached to emotionally. Normally, thoughts of her would demolish me- my mind would spiral into negative loops because of how much I missed her, because I knew how unlikely it was to find someone like her, and because of how I felt I could have stopped everything from falling apart. We dated for a short period of time- definitely less than four months- but I truly feel as if I’d never been happier. Ever. She came to me as I was pulling out of a dark place in my mind- when I would spend every day going to school and communicating but hardly ever feeling real. To some degree, possibly a rather high degree, I was dissociated from the impact of the beauty of my life and from emotion for most of my time before we were friends. And so she elevated me- she snuffed out all the negativity residing within my psyche. And when things broke down, I fell further than I was before. She was the only thing, I realized sometime around the painting period, which catalyzed my ability to recognize beauty in life and the universe more than the effects of the drug I’ve ingested. The drug showed me I may never experience that degree of happiness again, but happiness was still something to be sought. Perhaps this was an influence on the conversation me and my friend had on our walk. Never once do I really recall thinking about the girl I was romantically involved with during the bulk of the trip. My lovestrickeness was moreso with the girl I was hung up on. As the feet of my companion and I bounced joyfully down the street, we somehow got to the topic of my current romantic involvement. At the time, I didn’t see her as a complete dead end. But we had been together for an awful long time, and she gave me only a fraction of the happiness that my ex gave. At the same time, it’s important to note that my girlfriend of the time of the trip was rather psychotic- her hallucinations showed that we had very different interpretations of the universe, and that they were incompatible because I believed her visions were related to neuro-chemistry and not spirits. It was understandable though- her system of belief was given to her overtime by her mental issues and by the people that she spent most of her time with- which would be the ghost-hunting grandmother she lives with because her mom was a crack-addict. Perhaps I mentioned how she used to talk about marriage with me when I was uncomfortable with the very thought- seeing as, at the time, we had been together for less than four months. With our afterglow of psilocybin, we might have gone down a slope to the lake by his home. Around that area, and on our walk back to his residence, I had him make me a promise. In our heightened perception of the colors around us and that lingering mental clarity he said that no matter what the circumstances, if me and my girlfriend of the time were before him in the act of getting married, he would not hold his tongue. He would rise and say my name, followed my something similar to, “We made a promise after taking psychedelic mushrooms that, were this day to ever come, that I would object to this.”. We laughed and chattered down the street and into his house.

Experience:2 grams Psilocybe Cubensis + 2.7 grams Syrian Rue - The Psilohuasca Albino Fox,"I had been waiting to try this combination for a long time, I had been growing my own Cubensis Mushrooms but they weren't enough on their own. I ordered some Syrian Rue after doing some research and then waited for my next flush. The day after I had picked the mushrooms was a saturday which was convenient. I woke up that day and ate breakfast, then weighed up just under 3 grams of Rue and two grams of mushrooms (I thought this would be good for a first time dose). I ground up the Rue in a coffee grinder and put the powder into a jug, then I squeezed in half a lemon, (I had read that the citric acid helps to extract the Harmaline). I then poured boiling water in and let it brew for a while before straining it into a mug and adding honey. At 11:30AM I started drinking the brew and then exactly half an hour later I ate the mushrooms. Once I had eaten the mushrooms I got ready to go outside. I rode my bike around the fields until I found A nice tree to sit under. By this time the effects of the Rue were kicking in and I felt strange. It was a very humid day and I felt overheated and slightly nauseous. Anxiety began to creep its way in and I wandered what I had got myself in for, I rolled a cigarette and sat with this frame of mind for what must've been about 20 minuets, then things started moving. As the effects washed over me they also washed away the doubts and worries and even though the visuals were rapidly intensifying, I felt calm. Open eye visuals (OEV's) were warpy and fast moving and the longer I looked at one thing, the more interesting they got. I was reminded of the effects of smoking Changa. Closed eye visuals (CEV's) were mind blowing, again, faster moving than usual and complex 3D shapes and patterns formed almost instantly. Snake like creatures slithered across and tribalistic faces rotating on what looked like totem poles were but to mention a few things I saw. After a while of sitting down I decided to test the water and stand up, all my muscles felt weak but I could walk fine. I decided to go for an explore so I put my stuff back in my bag and picked up my bike. (this all took a while because I had to keep reminding myself to get on with what I was doing. As I was pushing the bike I noticed that I was experiencing auditory hallucinations as well. when the bike slowed down due to long grass, everything else seemed to slow down, it sounded like a record stopping then starting up again as the bike sped back up. I decided to ride the bike, this was really fun, as I moved foreword I saw ahead of me human shaped outlines like crop circles in the grass, which stayed in the same place as I rode past. Eventually I found myself a more wooded area and sat down under a young oak tree. as I sat there, taking in the experience my mind drifted to memories of friends and family. I felt an amazing sense of inner peace and happiness, as well as a connection to something ancient beyond belief. The bark of the oak tree felt amazing to the touch. Silly faces formed in the grass and I saw a playful side to the mushroom, I began to laugh out loud and this also felt really good. I sat there for a long time, sometimes with my eyes closed. When I stood up, I looked out to the field next to where I was standing and about about 20 yards away there stood a creature, It was like nothing I had seen before here in Sussex, England. At first I thought it was a cat, but it was bigger than your average house cat and it's ears were huge. It was Bright white and fluffy, with a long bushy tail. it looked more like it belonged to the dog family than anything else. Then it noticed me and it stood staring at me for a while, It's ears pricked up, This confirmed to me that it was wild, then it scarpered. I could see it running for a while before it's fluffy tail disappeared over the hill. I was startled, I knew this wasn't a hallucination, it was very real. I spent the next half an hour messing around on my bike and wandering joyfully what on earth that mysterious creature was. When I got back I looked online for the wild animals of Sussex, and one picture of a fox made something click. The fox looked just like the creature I had seen except for the white coat. I came to the conclusion that I had seen an Albino Fox. I lay down feeling like I could burst with happiness. I listened to the chirping birds outside the window and watched the room swirling around in a very gentle but DMT'ish way until the effects wore off. Of course you could say that seeing the Albino Fox whilst on Psilohuasca was nothing but a mere coincidence, but I believe there was something more going on there, something unexplainable. Note: The effects of the trip did not last as long as I had read they would though I can't say exactly how long they did. It felt like it lasted as long as I needed it too. Overall an amazing experience..

Experience: 1.5g Psilocybe Cubensis - Analysis of body and mind,"This was my first time taking shrooms, it was 1.5 grams of dried mushrooms. 19:45: I take my shrooms. They are chewy and they taste bad. I chewed them and swallowed them away with some ice tea. 20:30: This is where I begin to feel the effects of the shrooms. Especially my legs, they begin to feel heavy and it tickles. I'm watching some funny videos as I'm waiting for the shrooms to kick in. 20:40: I can feel that I'm getting out of balance. I can't keep my head in one place and it is just floating like a boat on the ocean. My legs feel very heavy and I am crawling on the ground. It feels amazing and I lie down on the floor. It makes me realize how much I appreciate my body. Everything on my body makes sense, why I need it and why it's important to me. I realize that my body and my mind are two completely different things and how amazing it is that my body and my mind are working so well together. An attempt of recreating a CEV I saw while tripping 20:45: Everything is so clear right now, I can hear everything. My breathing, my hair when I run my hands through it. My head feels pressurized and my eyes feel a bit heavy. It feels just like you are about to faint, but I didn't worry about this and moved this feeling to the background. Suddenly, my laughter is over and I can concentrate on the smallest things very easily. The sound of me writing on the paper is very pleasant. I also notice that my physical abilities are out of control. My handwriting is barely legible. I take a good look at my hands, I can see the pores very clear and gets my focus for several minutes. 21:00: It is going extremely fast in my head, yet my body moves so slow. I take a look outside the window and look at the lights. They are so vivid and clear. I decide to go laptop and play an online game of chess. I thought that if my mind is so bright right now I would be able to play chess very good and quick, but nothing is less true. As I play several moves I realize that the only thing of me that is playing right now, is my instinct. I'm having trouble calculating moves but managed to win the game. I step away from my laptop and take of my music. 21:25: It's silent, yet I hear everything. I take another look outside the window and a small breeze of the wind blows me away. I almost fell over. 21:39: My brain is thinking about so many things right now. My brain gives each thought a few seconds and jumps to the next one. I never understood why people on psychedelics are always floating with their arms, but now it makes sense. 21:48: Time is a factor that doesn't matter anymore. I realize that I'm talking to myself in my mind and ask myself, what is your purpose? Is life all about what you want to achieve? We do live in a society where achievements are an important factor. Is that important for yourself or for other people? Something completely different, they say that it's not possible to sleep when you're on shrooms, but what happens if you pass out? 21:50: Looking at the time, I'm amazed how much has happened in such a short period of time. I'm so active and go downstairs for some water. I had to remind myself because I had to go to the bathroom a lot of times. 00:20: What happened in between is a bit of a blind spot right now. My handwriting is illegible and saw that I've quit keeping track of everything. I'm coming down from the trip and don't feel the effects anymore. The back of my neck feels like it's having these little sparks on it. It's a pleasant feeling. 01:00: I'm writing the trip report and doze off to bed.","['acuity enhancement', 'auditory hallucination', 'conceptual thinking', 'focus suppression', 'internal hallucination', 'laughter', 'magnification', 'motor control loss', 'perception of bodily heaviness', 'physical euphoria', 'spontaneous tactile sensations', 'time distortion']",848
Experience:1.5 Grams Psilocybe Cubensis,"Yesterday, I ingested 1.5 grams of psilocybin mushrooms, and it was the most profound experience of my life.. 6:15PM - The come up I smoked some weed during the come up to keep me calm, and sort of ease myself into the experience. I took a couple hits off of a bong, and then took a 30 minute walk with a friend of mine..We'll call him ""Z"" 7:00 - I can feel it The effects are starting to be noticeable. No major hallucinations or incredible thoughts.. 7:30 - Coming on more Effects are becoming more and more noticeable. Feeling as if I'm rising up, above myself. 7:55 - Wow Starting to see shit. My vision is somewhat tunneled with a pink glow around it. Occasionally seeing faint little spirals around my vision. At this point, I grab my journal and begin writing..As well as some food..Weed was making me hungry. 8:10 - Still coming up Spirals are increasing in frequency, and I feel an intense desire to explain how I'm feeling..It's a struggle to write..Words are unusually large..Unsatisfied with my in-ability to describe how I'm feeling. A desire to describe and frame what I'm seeing. 8:40 - COMING UP MORE Still rising. I begin to think very hard on topics. Critical self evaluation. Seeing a grid in the void with green lines spanning..Thoughts are wild..Coming to a conclusion. Seeing this consciousness as separate from my regular bodies consciousness. There seem to be different levels of consciousness..Regular functioning (influenced heavily by societal expectations), The come up (realization of things), my current state (borderline enlightenment), and so on.. The upper left half of my face seems to have become something of a different material..Like, the left half of my head had been altered. This was neither positive nor negative..It just was 8:50 - PEAK All of life has been explained..I am enlightened. My subconscious seems to be speaking to me. I'm listening to the song ""DMT by XXYYXX"". I feel as though I've ascended. Things have become ever so clear..I realize I am merely playing the game of life..I don't feel as though I've reached the top of all things, however I am surely very high. 8:55 - Return Enlightenment has faded..The memory of how I felt is craved..I begin writing furiously..But then pause..and Realize that now that I have seen it, there is no need to explain..It's funny..Life..Life is merely a collection of comedic things..We are just playing in it. I reach the conclusion that, I would like to explain in depth my feeling, however words do that very feeling an injustice.. 9:00 - Another conclusion The state of enlightenment that I reached can only be described as ""a lot to take in""..Seeing things from that perspective is overwhelmingly beautiful 9:30 - Steady decline Visuals have faded, as have intense thoughts..All I can seem to think about now is how I did feel..That state of mind Coming down - Thoughts are fading..I've come back to earth 10:00 - Relax I feel relaxed. I've seen everything as it is, and realize that verbalizing my experience will be incredibly difficult, though I will attempt in 10:30 - Almost done Friends leave, half an hour late..I get my things ready for the next day, and lay down. I am incredibly relaxed, but not able to sleep..I enjoy just relaxing 11:30 - Goodnight I doze off.. 7:00 - Good morning I prepare for my day, and have a great desire to tell people about my experience..Oddly enough, I no longer have a desire to smoke weed..This worries me at first, thinking weed isn't enough, however I realize that while I was smoking weed, I was looking for something a little bit more, and mushrooms took me that extra step..I have no desire to get high in the near future. My day continues on, and I'm a little bit lost in thought, thought incredibly smiley..It's almost as if I'm re-discovering some of the aspects of my life..Some of my desires from before I did shrooms are no longer as appealing..I feel somewhat of a bond with nature..I think I'm going to take a walk in the woods after this post... Thanks for reading. This was one of the most important things that has ever happened to me..I've seen things from a new perspective, and I feel that the road ahead holds intense happiness.

Experience:1g of stars and love,"There were five of us taking the sacrament, all consuming 1gr of dry cubensis. We prepared by doing our regular morning practices though it was evening; meditated, did some fear inventory regarding the ceremony and set our intentions before slowly eating the mushroom. They were quite tasty and nutty in flavour and it felt good to talk to them, sing and connect. I had taken 4.5gr in the past and someone else had had a few trips with a few grams. One person was new to the mushroom and two had consumed but in setups where there was a lot of mixing with other substances so they didn't have a clear memory of the mushroom. The location was in the countryside We started after 10pm and we had a few children around at the beginning as there were shooting stars and everyone wanted to see them. After 20 minutes from consuming them, the effects started to become hard to handle. People were giddy and the stars twinkling had a sensational effect. The children were sent to bed and I took over the music as I was aware of the strength of the trip. We had anticipated we could dance and talk and it was looking increasingly unlikely that would be possible. The room was in almost darkness with lights off and 2 candles on the table. We had prepared water, slices of apple and dark chocolate. There was also a pasta bake ready to be consumed later as we had fasted for several hours; myself since lunch time. We had set the music on my friend's mobile and saved it there as the wifi was terrible. As I couldn't unlock it and the songs started to be real jarring I resorted to ""next"" them, as I knew there were some good ones I had added. The pop came when I got Chernobyl by Blanck Mass; that song is made to open you to shrooms. I put the volume up and told them all to relax and let the mushroom open them. I told them to exhale and let it all out (one was crying) as I felt some got a bit tense. I played next Forgive by Burial and a couple more in that tone. My friends were all lying down with eyes closed and tripping to the max, the newbie reported having strong visuals and one of the girls saw loads of animals and eventually tripped herself to sleep. I realised I was the only one standing and I did not want to spend the entire trip selecting the music so I tried to get the Organic Vibrations Spotify playlist on my friend's mobile to no avail. I often release physically (vomit or diarrhoea) when I do entheogens, and this time it wasn't the exception. I went to the loo and on my way grabbed my phone that I knew had the list saved. After some struggle getting the speaker sorted, the list was on and we could all sink in. We were in a major inward trip until 2.45 pm. Every so often I could feel that someone cried, shook or tensed up and I kept reminding them to relax and exhale. We all are avid meditators and have body-related practices, so our bodies are super sensitive and we all reported a major increase in sensitivity, not only visuals. My body basically vibrated with the music and entered full synaesthesia at the rhythm of the musical waves. I could feel how the music was used by the mushroom to travel in my body and open it up. At some point, in one intense bit I could feel my buddies were getting a bit tight and I recognise the spot, as I was there in my first trip. I told them that was how love felt like and to receive it. One of my friends told me that hearing that helped her relax and welcome that level of sensation. I had beautiful visuals and loads of loving sensation from the mushroom. In conversation with it, I kept going about my intention: wanting to feel beautiful. I got that it is a practice and for parts of the trip, to focus my attention on not engaging my mind and just enjoying it. It took all I had to just receive it. The mushroom appeared to me at various times as goblin looking man who was making fun. The visuals were very colourful and full of figures and people. I was happy I was close to nature as it felt warm and engulfing. I had three peaks and all of them I felt I couldn't do anything else but to surrender to the visuals and the sensation. I did not want to move nor talk. We didn't speak much except for the odd change of music when someone didn't like much the song, and I just simply ""next"" it as the list is pretty good. At 2.45 some of us had some pasta, chocolate and apples. The playlist had finished and I played it again with less volume, to continue the trip and slowly ground. We ended up drifting into sleep and waking up around 5 am to go properly to bed. Woke up a few hours later and had a good breakfast and a walk; felt really happy and so did all my friends.

Experience:400ug MiPLA - Restful Bliss,"8:13: 200ug MiPLA tab under the tongue, no taste, tab larger than most I've received 9:00: there definitely is a hint of something coming on, colors are beginning to appear brighter, in better humor than usual, blankets feel extra soft. 10:00: effects haven't risen much from last check-in, taking one more 200ug tab 10:30: first tab appears to have kicked in full force, and second tab creeping up behind it, colors are even brighter, very slight visuals, light drifting, heavy tracers, words slightly wiggle on pages or screens, my sense of touch is incredibly heightened, everything feels amazingly soft, I have that euphoric electric body high that I usually get from lady Lucy, only less sharp, this is a very comfortable yet powerful feeling compound, it feels important although not as intense as most psychedelics. 11:00: there is no anxiety so far with this substance, and I am I person with very high anxiety and am very prone to bad trips, no changes, just wanted to note that. 11:30: bit of anxiety for about 10 minutes but some high cbd juice in my vape cleared that right up, visuals have become more intense but not by much, the visuals are pronounced yet they dont jump out at you forcefully like more potent psychs, body high is simply amazing almost orgasmic, everything I see is so beautiful, I keep getting stuck thinking about how the body is made to rise in the morning and fall in the evening. 12:00: all of the sudden this substance has gone from stimulating to being slightly sedating, eyes are dry and heavy, I'm very tired yet very wide awake, maybe this is not from the substance? Maybe I am just naturally tired? Who knows. Effects have dropped off slightly. From 10:30 to now I was at +++ on the shulgin scale, now I am ++ 400ug seems to be a sweet spot for me 1:00: I'm quite tired and would like to sleep however this molecule surely won't let me, 7.5mg hydrocodone and I am off to bed.","['analysis enhancement', 'anxiety', 'colour enhancement', 'conceptual thinking', 'drifting', 'increased heart rate', 'physical euphoria', 'pupil dilation', 'sedation', 'spontaneous bodily sensations', 'stimulation', 'tactile enhancement', 'tracers']",449
Experience:Into the Multiverse,"I began the night by dosing 8 tabs of relatively strong (150-200µg/tab) LSD. This was a relatively high dose, even for myself, who has been regularly dosing for about two years, but my intention was to see how deep the rabbit hole went. On top of that, I dosed 250mgs of MXE, 100mgs intranasally and the other 150 I capped and devoured. (Time will be posted in a T+ manner, where the numbers following T is the approximate time since the experience began) T-0:00 (~2:00 pm)I pop the tabs into my awaiting mouth, preparing for a day/night of excitement. T-0:45 I begin to feel the effects of the LSD, in the form of a feeling of rising excitement. It is at this point I go to check my mail, and realize that my 1g sample of MXE had come in the mail. Needless to say, I am as excited as a child on Christmas. T-1:00 After capping five 50 mg capsules of MXE, I am ready to see how intense the LSD was going to get, before dosing the new drug. T-2:00 The visuals are getting intense, objects begin flowing together in various fractal patterns, frame splitting of reality becomes apparent as the car I was in accelerates to speed. I decide to dose 50 mgs of MXE nasally, to test the effects. T-2:30 I have decided to do the rest of the MXE, seeing as I have a high dissociative tolerance, and the 50mgs was, if anything, grounding to the trip. T-3:15 The MXE has taken effect. The NMDA antagonism is combining well with the LSD. The usually overwhelming emotional aspect of the LSD has become managable by the intense logical progression of my thoughts from the MXE. Visuals are no longer geometric, but, rather, ""customizable"", inr the sense that my thoughts affected the underlying forms of the hallucinations. T-3:30 Something weird has begun to happen. I find myself mapping the world geometrically, with almost perfect awareness of my location in 3D space. I find, however, that if I shift my focus internally, it appears as if everything that could be happening is happening all at once, in a superposition on itself, only to collapse into a certain reality upon the return of my focus. Also, I have found myself very perceptive to the energy people are putting off, only because I feel a certain energy and ask them about it. My accuracy is starting to freak people out, so I shall stop, so as not to ruin their trip. Weird, wacky stuff. T-4:00-7:00 We spend three hours in the mountains, exploring. It was a great time, and I have never felt so at one with nature. T-8:00 I return home and went to bed, full of thoughts to ponder.

"Experience:1,55mg LSD - The Report","Need to write this down as long the wounds are fresh. Background: I never neglected my drug use, not that im proud of it or anything, its just a thing i enjoy/experience depending on the substance. I lost my grandfather this year and felt totally shit. Not only because of his death, but because of the hate for myself for not caring about bonding with my grandparents and my family overall. Not like they treated me bad or anything, its just that i was basicly a loner since i can remember and didnt feel the need for bonding with anyone. Since i dont need anything from anyone i expected same from others. Oh how wrong i was! And it did actually catched up with me after he died. It was also the first death in my family and all the grief and pain hit me unexpectedly. Set: As stated above i felt terrible about myself. Am i really such an asshole? Am i the least reliable person in my family? I had so many regrets at this point towards my relationship with my closest ones. It was very depressing. I decided to dose in hope it will get rid of my depressed state and perhaps give myself some answers and fix my shit. Not that couldnt do it without L. Its just my soul screamed for it. Also last winter i did totally fine on 1.2mg of Lucy so i decided to top the dose a lil bit. Setting: The usual... My room brightly lit with green walls no music. The Trip: +0.00: Injested 13 blotters, +0.10: ""To hell with it!"" and ate the remaining 2,5 blotters , +0.15: Sat in front of the pc checking emails and shit munching on the paper alsmost puking at one point after some got stuck in my throat. +0.25: It came on fucking strong and fast and i started to feel disoriented and anxious so i wrote my BFF what ive done. +0.40: The onset started and it was so intense i got scared as fuck, didnt expect that since the last 1,2mg trips comeup was smooth and enjoyable. I never experienced a true ego-loss or at least thats what i like to think. This time though it was different. I started to feel distant, like theres less and less of me inside. The Depersonalization intensified with every second and i started to panic, meanwhile the room started to warp and move with such intensity it was crazy. this went on for a couple of minutes, maybe 10 or so and wrote my friend and reddit whats going on. It started to get tight in my chest and i decided to lay down on my bed. +1.00 I closed my eyes and my mind started to wander here and there. The content was mostly related to all the bad things ive done and my the elements of my personality i hate. A total ego trip occured. I tried to let go but somehow i couldnt. I kept bouncing back to those thoughts about myself. +2.00 Guess ill drop the timeline from here since i have no clue about the chronology of the trip at this point cause alot of stuff started to repeat itself. I was trying to let go badly. But i couldnt. I could compare it with falling asleep, with the difference that every time i i was close to ""sleep"" ""die"" or even better, lets call it ""breaking through something"" I kept opening my eyes with my heart racing and a paralising fear in my head. The fear was sooooo fucking familiar. It was exactly the same fear i felt during some of my nightmares i had as a 6-7 year old kid. I could connect it to some trauma i must have had perhaps as a baby, but i couldnt remember it at all. This happened everytime i tried to let go for the next maybe 2 hours while my mind was still wandering in my ""realm of negativities"". Then Something happened, I didnt breakthrough the invincible wall i kept banging my head against. but at some point i started to see a mesh layered before my eyes. It looked like a green/blue forcefield around me and after a while i started to feel strange sensations inside my head. They were accompanying the thoughts basicly. Every thought i was cycling through gave me a needle like sensation in my brain. I started to get delusional thinking i got a stroke or something. After the idea of brain damage, i started to feel tactile sensations that i head earlier on a 400μg trip. i though im bleeding from my eyes nose and ears. I reached for them but my fingers where clean. Felt such Relief at this point and then something in me snapped. I felt disconnected from me. My mind was Floating in some sort of empty void while noticing something is emerging out of me. Peter was dead i wasnt him anymore. I somehow transformed into a new entity. It was such a bliss, i felt like everything is exactly how its supposed to be. I could stay in this state like forever. It was an feeling of merging with something far greater than us. At this point i knew i got both all the answers and all the questions inside me. Fuck me! I didnt even feel the need to ask any of them. I lingered in this state for quite a long time. Then after I was gone, couldnt grasp any thoughts, couldnt relate to anything, i was just lying there with an empty mind blinded by some sort of warm, pulsating light. +-5:00 Went to the bathroom looked in the mirror terrified of how i looked. I was so fucked up i could play a zombie in a voodoo movie or something. Took a piss went to the kitchen where i walked in circles having no clue what i actually wanted. I was so tired of the trip so i thought perhaps downing a bottle of vodka would help me to kill the trip. I opend the fridge no vodka there. (I dont drink at all and there were never any vodka anyway). Grabbed a glass and a bottle of water and staggered back to bed. After this i cant recall anything what was going on. Im sure i didnt sleep but its like something erased all my memory. +10:00 Another trip to the bathroom. Everything was drifting in so strongly i was amazed how long this stuff lasts. Then went back to bed. I slowly started to recall things from my past, i saw images of my parents, co-workers, friends, grandparents and saw something like scenes from my past projected in my head. Then i managed to fall into the abyss again laying there... with an empty mind. +14:00 Something snapped in me again. everything was outlined with a purple aura i recognized this as the end of the trip.Turned some music on ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GXRWfZrf8E ), took my comfy chair to the balcony sat in it and lightened up a cigar contemplating what i just went through. Conclusion: I was somewhat dissapointed i didnt get the answers i wanted, but at the same time i was amazed about the fear related to my childhood. WTF happened to back then i have no clue but i can say for sure it had something to do with my babyhood. From what my parents told me i was born dead and the doctors managed to save me, so i played with that thought but in the end i think its the fear i felt in my mothers womb while being forced out of it. The mind is truly a riddle and it makes me sad i might not solve this mystery in my lifetime. Also i feel absolutely relieved and full of energy while writing this. Guess it was a good call to hop on this train...

Experience:4x 200ug tabs - You do not need to understand,"I first noticed I was tripping when I was staring at a caterpillar on the ground beneath my crossed legs. I lost interest in everything else around me (and the 3 friends I was with) very quickly, and just watched this caterpillar, which was rearing up and was swaying in a circular motion. The ground then looked as though it stretched out forever, and was more intricately detailed than I had ever noticed before, and the ground itself started swaying in a circular motion, along with the caterpillar. Then I noticed lots of beautiful patterns, and colours had become more vibrant. I was tripping on acid for the first time! It began! I don’t remember everything that happened that day, as I went through ego death (for the first time), but I remember that the sea looked as though I needed 3D glasses to see it; it had the same disjointed green and blue colour effect you see on those printed 3D images you view with those cheap glasses. Everything was more vibrant (the greens were greener, etc), but also everything had a purple tint to it, like a thin film of purple had been laid over the world (just like when you see oil in water and catch the sunlight in it). I looked at the treetops from a distance and saw that their colour was pulsating, switching between green and purple and red and back again, like they were having colour poured onto them, one colour after another. It was lovely. ""We got to a cave and I followed my friend Josikins inside."" My friends took me on a tour of the park, and it didn’t feel like I was walking at all; the walk on uneven ground was very easy, almost like I was floating, and it also felt like the ground was rounder than normal and was rotating beneath my feet, so that the world was moving around me and not me walking over it. We got to a cave and I followed my friend Josikins inside, and out again through a small side passage that takes you to the front of the cave again. After I got to the side of the cave entrance I saw my friend lead me inside it, from a 3rd person perspective, just a few metres from me. It didn’t blow me away, I just thought it was pretty cool, and carried on following my friend through the foliage. We were on our way back to the original spot, and Josikins took me into the secret 'Shaman Hut' (which is a modest construction; essentially a lean-to made from canvas against a tree). The Hut looked quite small on the outside, but was enormous on the inside and reminded me of a Bedouin tent. she showed me a book of the universe, with pictures of planets and nebulae and such, but I still thought she was a demi-god and I thought she was showing me the history of the universe through the medium of this book. The pictures became 3D holograms floating above the pages and I kept asking to know more ""What happens next?"" I asked, and she turned the page and up popped another 3D hologram of a nebula. ""How did it begin?"" I got around to asking, and she showed me the front of the book, giggling, showing me the page on the very inside of the hard front cover (it was just a pattern, maybe it was of a very zoomed-in image of a nebula), but I saw a swirling purple and pink gas that represented nothingness! We got back to where we started our trip, overlooking the sea, and I was lost in thought. I was convinced that either I had transcended and was among demi-gods, or that I had died and was on my way to paradise. This wasn’t scary, as the day was too beautiful and I was feeling so fucking happy. The only thing that bothered me that my girlfriend wasn’t there, which I thought meant that I had left her behind when I died, for which I felt guilty, or that I had transcended without her, for which I felt guilty. I kept asking my friends if I had died, or when my girlfriend would get the chance to transcend, but I can’t remember their answers. Probably reassuring ones. All I remembered of the day, of my life even, was taking those tabs and trekking up this huge fucking hill, so I thought that all that had ever existed started when I took those tabs, and that life before then was fake. ""I went through ego death and got stuck in a loop, from which my friends saved me by giving me the phrase ‘You do not need to understand’ to read over and over again on a piece of paper"" I was asking questions aloud to my friends/guardian spirits, like “When did you get here?” (by which I meant, ‘When did you beings come into existence?’), and my friend replied “We’ve been here the whole time, dude” (this proved to me that they were divine). Another friend got up to put something in his backpack, and I thought he was about to jump off the cliff, and I suddenly felt frightfully scared at the prospect, and said “No! Don’t jump!” (thinking instantly of the tales one hears about people who take acid and think they can fly), but he merely said “Why would I jump?”, and that blew away all preconceptions about drugs that I had ever heard from figures of authority! Of course he wasn’t going to jump, why the fuck would he do that? This stuff doesn’t turn you into a moron/zombie/junkie/whatever, we really have been lied to! I then started to think of the authorities in a negative (true?) light that I never really considered before. It was ‘Us’ (the psychedelic community), and ‘Them’ (authority), and I had declared my unwavering support for the former. I thought that I was being recruited by LSD entities (who were just my friends in reality), as some sort of foot soldier in the on-going struggle for liberty! These thoughts passed when I went through ego death and got stuck in a loop, from which my friends saved me by giving me the phrase ‘You do not need to understand’ to read over and over again on a piece of paper (see pics). ""I felt as though the universe had just given me all of its musical knowledge that had ever existed or would ever be"" The next hour or so I don’t remember, but it was deep. And very beautiful and liberating. One friend stayed behind to keep me company through all this while the other two went exploring, and I asked stuff from time to time (still thinking he was divine); “Where did you come from?” I asked, and he replied by touching my heart and whispering “We came from inside.” Looking back on it he was simply trolling me, but my mind was blown, again. Eventually the others came back and were encouraging me to play my mandolin for them, which I had brought along, naively thinking that the LSD would make me some cosmically-inspired virtuoso on an instrument that isn’t my first choice when making music. They were encouraging me to play, and I felt as though the universe had just given me all of its musical knowledge that had ever existed or would ever be; all of the thousands of years’ worth of musical talent on earth had just been given to me, and now I knew all there could be about music – however I just about managed to (poorly) strum an out-of-tune A chord on my cheap mandolin, and I just burst into laughter. It felt like a Twilight Zone form of irony; despite all of the beauty and perfection one can create in their mind, man is just too imperfect to be able to convey these arts without losing the original thought’s substance. “Words are an encumbrance to meaning”, just as my clumsy ape hands couldn’t convey the music I was hearing at the time. Then I looked at my mandolin and saw Egyptian pyramids where my frets were, and handed the thing to my friend to look at (and also to stop myself from trying to play the mandolin). Another thing I remember about the trip was the audio effects; everything was ‘swooshy’, like the phasing effect on a flanger, and when I inhaled deeply I heard fluttering – like my inhaled breath was making a purring sound. This has happened on other acid trips since, and I clearly hear this when I listen to music; if I listen to a song and take a deep breath, the drums often sound like they’re speeding up, and when I exhale they slow down to normal tempo, all without making the song sound terrible (it actually sounds really cool). I came down from my trip pretty dramatically; if you can make your eyes quiver or shiver by tensing them (a lot of people can do this, I just don’t know the name for it) then that’s exactly what I see when coming down from acid. In the trips since my first experience it just meant I was coming down, but on my first trip I was sober immediately after. Even though my friends continued to smoke weed to keep the trip going, or to make the visuals more intense, then weed did nothing but get me high. But I was content. We sat on the hill overlooking our home town, and watched the sun go down on one of the best days of my life.

Experience: 660ug LSD - First bad trip,"After about 30 minutes I saw the first effects, I was playing Guitar Hero and it was progressively getting a lot harder to play. In my peripheral vision I kept seeing people looking at me which was strange, I started getting bad nausea and had to stop playing. About another hour passed and it was hitting me pretty hard, I kept staring at my friend and asking him ""What?"" because I thought he was talking to me when he didn't say anything. One of my other friends starting playing a game and I had no idea what was going on, I was stuck in multiple thought loops and just kept getting very confused. I kept asking my friends to explain what was going on. During the peak I was looking at the crazy amount of geometry and the outline of it just kept expanding... it's hard to explain. I just kept staring at it and eventually it had replicated so much it looked like I was in a totally white room with a strobe light in the middle with lasers flashing everywhere. I remember feeling really peaceful and like I was connected to the universe. Also during this time when I moved my head it was like there was a spotlight behind me that pointed wherever I looked, and the lights kept flashing. My memory of this part is very bad, I don't usually get memory loss from tripping. Suddenly I was in the toilet and I thought my urine was blood, I made my sober friend check and he said it was normal. I started panicking and then I looked at his face, his eyes were huge and black and there was blood pouring out of his mouth and ears. He was saying to me ""there's no blood"" and in my head I was thinking ""What is he talking about, I'm covered in it"" I looked at the walls and they turned black, my vision was going black and white and I lost most of my vision. My friend coughed and I saw her coughing up blood, there was just blood everywhere... All over the floor, all over my friends. I tried to call an ambulance but thankfully my friend took my phone off of me before I was able to. I remember the feeling of just intense fear and panic, it felt like all the blood had drained from my body - I felt my heart and it was beating so fast. I said out loud to my friends ""I'm dying - I'm dead"" they said I was fine and needed to calm down, but I couldn't. I went upstairs to lay down to try calm myself but it didn't work, my friend came up to check on me and I left my room to go downstairs. Then I said to him ""We're all dead"" in my head we had all overdosed, I know you can't overdose on LSD but I thought maybe it wasn't LSD. Even though the person I was talking to hadn't taken anything I thought he was dying too, in response to my comment about us all being dead he replied ""I know"". Which really messed with my head, when he said that I thought we all knew we were dying and were trying to reassure each other in our final moments. Walking down the stairs I kinda snapped out of it briefly and realised what was going on, that I was just in a bad trip. I remember thinking ""Oh I get it now"" in realisation, then I got caught in a thought loop of ""Have I realised this before?"" then ""Have I realised that I realised it before?"" so on about 10 times until I snapped out of it. I went back into the living room and my friends still looked like they were bleeding, around this time I realised I was imagining it all as then when I realised that all the blood went away. Once I was not panicking I realised I could make the blood come out at will, controlling the hallucinations. This was pretty fun, but I kept getting thoughts like ""But what if I really am dying?"" and as soon as I got it an intense wave of panic just went all over my body. I kept having to reassure myself that I wasn't dying. After that I managed to enjoy the visuals, I was watching the geometry dance around the room and suddenly 3D structures began to materialise in front of me, it looked like I could touch them. I kept making these structures form until eventually it wore off enough to the point I couldn't see them anymore. Even after I stopped panicking the fear of death persisted throughout the night, and I was just waiting for it to end so I knew I wasn't going to die. Even though this was a bad trip I'm glad I had it, as I think it will help reassure me that I'm not dying if I were to have those thoughts again on a later trip.","['amnesia', 'anxiety', 'anxiety suppression', 'auditory hallucination', 'delusion', 'external hallucination', 'geometry', 'thought loops', 'unity and interconnectedness']",987

Experience:437.5Î¼g LSD - Everything at once,"It was Canada day and me and some buddies decided to go to our one buddies place and do LSD. I had done it before 6 times before this event, so I was by this point fairly experienced with the drug. For the most part, I knew what to expect, what the come up felt like and what the visuals would peak at. I was very comfortable with the effects. My buddy had a house that was near enough to Toronto to drive to, but far enough into the boonies that his lot was huge and he was mostly surrounded by small farms and big middle-of-nowhere style houses. It would make the ideal spot for a trip. I took the subway up to a friends place and then we drove the rest of the way. Shortly after arriving, we dropped the tabs. I took 3 1/2 125μg tabs, which amounted 437.5μg in total. My other 3 friends consumed variously between 2 and 2 1/2 tabs, so between 250μg and 312.5μg at 1:10PM. We went outside and started playing with the Frisbee and generally just chilling and listening to music. After a while, our friend and host convinced us to go on a nature walk throughout the woods in his backyard (initially by telling us that there was a rusted car and bus back there but this later turned out to be a lie to convince us to go, it was just a walk). While we were out walking, the high of the LSD really started to kick in. I find that when your in nature you don't really notice as much perceptually. You get the body high and the internal feelings, but without a solid texture to look at you really don't very much in visuals, besides a general feeling of intensity in your perceptions. We ventured through a lot of tall grass, down a hill, through a marshy area and through a newly planted corn field, eventually arriving at a fence. At this point we decide to turn around and walk back. During the walk back, one of our buddies who was walking slower then the rest of the group gets lost after falling behind. After finding him, he later sat down in the tall grass and let himself intentionally get lost, apparently experiencing a profound feeling of oneness while in the grass. It is fortunate that he found his way home after we left him there. After we got back, we all undress, put on bathing suits and get into a hot tub. The hot tub felt really nice with the LSD and it was only after getting back and seeing the textures in the stone of the patio, the granite inside the house and the walls that I really realize just how whacked out I was. After sitting in the hot tub for a while, I decide to smoke a bowl of weed. I used to be a huge pot head, but had quit several months earlier, only doing it occasionally. My previous experiences with LSD led me to believe that the two would combine in a similar way that weed combines with alcohol - producing a great amplification of the effects of both drugs that is easy to underestimate. I had no idea what was in store for me. After smoking the bowl of weed, this is where the truly profound effects of LSD started to hit me - a level of the drug that I had not been to before and was not expecting to go on that day. I sat in the hot tub for a while after smoking the bowl, initially just becoming slightly anxious. I wasn't totally sure what to do, and was having difficulty following peoples conversations or even forming thoughts of my own. It didn't bother me very much initially. I got out of the hot tub and started searching for my sun glasses - this proved to be extremely difficult. I couldn't keep my mind on the task at hand for more then a second at a time. My mind repeatedly just went empty - too overloaded with sensation to maintain coherent focus on any one thing. I never did find my sunglasses. Eventually I sat down and thought to myself, ""what would happen if this feeling just took over? What if I just couldn't think anymore?"" I imagined the feeling taking over, and the information rushing into my mind faster then I could process. It was ironic that this half joking thought was what triggered me to fully enter the LSD high, Geometry Level 8A. I had imagined it taking over, and in that very moment it took over. Whether the thought was the trigger or a result of what was happening anyhow is anyone’s guess. Initially I was very confused. I didn't like the feeling at all. My internal narrative had completely stopped - I could no longer form thoughts. Multiple words would come at the same time and they just didn't form a sentence or a coherent idea. When I opened my eyes, although I saw the outer world, it did not fully register. It was as if the what I was seeing was not properly transforming into higher level concepts. I could not decide what to do with objects in my world or what to do with myself. I reported to my friends that I had entered a really weird state of mind and was not feeling well. I reported being very confused and unable to think or do anything. I reported multiple times that they probably could do anything with me in that state - I would have been very easy to lead. It was somewhat surprising that I was capable of talking at all, although slightly broken. My internal narrative had completely vanished, but I was still capable of controlling my mouth to some extent. A feeling of doubt and worry took over for a while - was I stuck like this? Permanently depersonalized from my conscious experience? My biggest fear at this point was that it would stay like this forever - where I couldn't think and that I would be a permanent zombie, in capable of leading people or doing anything but follow the most basic commands. Was this what a bad trip is? I wanted to be normal again. After about 30 to 45 minutes and some laying in the grass, I started to accept the feeling more and it no longer gave me anxiety. I started to make sense of what was going on while it was going on, and that's when I really started to enjoy it. I had consistently increased the dosage of my LSD experiences, from 240 on previous days through to 437 that day. I wanted to see what it was like to get ""drunk"" on LSD - what the limit was and I had found it. The Geometry Level 8A experience is exactly like they describe in the article on psychonaut here, but you really don't get it until you go through it. I really was experiencing everything at the same time - or while maybe not entirely everything, there were many things simultaneously. It was as if you had just turned the whole brain on. Instead of having a single thing that I was paying attention to, I started feeling like I was getting multiple thoughts simultaneously. It was no wonder why I couldn't form sentences or thoughts any more - multiple words would be bubbling up to my higher level consciousness in parallel. It reminded me like a pot of boiling water, where each bubble was a thought. While initially its a steady stream, as the pot heats up to a rapid boil, the bubbles are just so random and all over the place that you can no longer understand them. My entire linguistic, visual, and semantic systems where firing all at once. It felt like I was experiencing all possible futures and all pasts and all of the present all at once. All ideas, words, concepts, images, all just seemed to be appearing at the same time in an incomprehensible cacophony. Even different ways of forming my sentences and different choices of words appeared simultaneously. When I opened my eyes, my world was overlayed with an extremely strong hexagon like grid that felt like it was all three colors at the same time. It became nearly impossible to talk aloud, let alone maintain an internal narrative. My mind was fried. It was a very weird state of mind - where your internal narrative, your ability to make sense of the world and make any decisions related to your senses were all gone. It was a complete ego death - I was fully enveloped by my brain lit up like a light bulb. It was fundamentally different from lower doses of LSD and from normal, coherent thinking. After a while, it started to calm down and could have some thoughts again. I started having these weird, profound and probably wrong insights into how the world works. I got this strong sense that intelligence existed in abstract, outside of biological brains. That I was experiencing something that creatures all around the universe experienced. Aliens would evolve on foreign worlds with completely different concept networks, but if you lit up their whole brain in the same way, they would experience precisely the same thing - a strong connectedness with all the universe and all of existence, everything that can or will exist. I felt like I was going on a right of passage almost. Treading a path that Steve Jobs and other great leaders had done before me - like gods of some kind had put me on a course to experience this. I screamed out ""Why me! Why Today?"" multiple times. At one point I became convinced that I was set up - my friends and and this whole days entire purpose was for me to break through to this level of LSD experience and this connectedness with everything. That my friends knew this was going to happen and it was all in the plan. Not true, of course, but at the time it was the only thing that made sense. I also had this repeating pattern, along with all of the other thoughts that were occurring simultaneously, was that ""This is why you do LSD. The visuals are just the pussy shit compared to this miraculous internal feeling. Having the whole brain turned on at once."" I felt like I was experiencing something profound - that everything in my life had lead up to this point just for me to experience that. I felt that I was going to extract some great insight into the nature of intelligence from it - the fact that this weird state of mind was even possible had to mean something. But at the same time I remember shouting that ""it could be meaningless! It might mean nothing!"", a reference to the fact that I might not extract any meaningful insights from the experience at all. I was just fucked up and it wasn't really going to change my life. The weed wore down and with it the most extreme effects of the geometry. Soon I was able to form thoughts in my own head again. The return of an internal narrative and an ability to react to and interpret the backyard of my buddies house was greatly welcomed. I chilled with my buddies, thankful that they had taken care of me. Especially during that initial half hour to 45 minutes of the geometry where I didn't know what was happening other then that I was no longer thinking or processing information normally - the part where I was anxious. Later on in the evening, almost 10 hours after first taking the LSD, I smoked another bowl of weed. I noticed that this caused some return of the feelings that I had earlier - the feeling of experiencing everything at once and no longer being able to follow conversations. However, fortunately it never became as bad that evening - never strong enough to cause me to start having broken thoughts, but it reinforced the notion that it was only the LSD in combination with the weed that had caused this profound state of mind in me. Overall it was a great day. For almost 2 hours, I was experiencing everything that could exist in my head all at once. My entire sense of time was deprived, and it felt like all information was just flowing through me. It no longer came to a point - no single thing that I was paying attention to, but instead a cacophony of incomprehensible thoughts and concepts occurring simultaneously, bubbling randomly like a rapid boiling pot of water. It was scary at first, but after easing into it, I was able to enjoy it for almost 2 hours before my thoughts started reforming again. I think my experiences with the psychedelics are over, for now at least. If what I wanted was to have something mind-blowing, something that fundamentally altered my state of mind, I had got there. It was yesterday with that 437.5μg of LSD and that bowl of weed. I had experienced something that was fundamentally different from normal experience - and fundamentally different than all of my previous LSD experiences, where my thoughts mostly stayed normal and comprehensible. I don't think I need to light my brain up like that again for quite a while. I need to give my mind a break. But overall it was well worth it. If you plan to take LSD with the intention of exploring level 8A Geometry, all I would say is that you make sure you are in good company, with people who can reassure you that your safe, that this happened because of the LSD and that you will return normal soon. When your in this state, all sense of how you got there and where you are going will disappear. You will experience it all at once - all possible pasts, all possible futures, and every word and linguistic concept will manifest simultaneously.","['8a geometry exposure to semantic concept network', 'ego death', 'multiple thought streams']",2723

I've been one with reality, God, oneness, being Some of the experiences I've had are almost ineffable, there aren't words to describe them. This experience has given me a lot to think about in terms of how consciousness emerges. It seems that LSD links together your visual cortex with other areas of your brain, I felt like I was able to see 'see' my mind in completely new ways that provided genuine insight into the nature of existence. Taking hits of nitrious while on LSD instantly bought me to ego-death in exquisite detail. As if I was able to see my sense of self construct itself in real time from inanimate matter. I feel like I was able to see for minutes what people might spend years and years meditating towards to catch a glimpse of. My entire sense of self has changed. I could see myself see the space between my perceptions and watched in real time as my sense of 'self' dissolved as the framerate of consciousness broke down. At times it almost felt like I was perceiving reality on some higher plane of consciousness, some different frequency than normal, it felt like I was just the cog of some global brain, some underlying global mind that exists on a different level of consciousness than our own. It seems that consciousness is not nearly as complicated as I thought it would be, but is a pattern that naturally flows from particle interactions like a fractal. There's something very fundamental and not-complicated at all about the way consciousness is implemented, a fundamental pattern that repeats itself. As times it felt like I was almost merging in with other possible universes. Different possible way reality could be. I felt like I was seeing different lifetimes flash before my eyes, that I was seeing something incredibly fundamental and mathematical about trust and resource allocation in connection with reality, existence, and being. For those of you who are not aware I'm very interested in artificial intelligence and I've been researching different projects that attempt to replicate human intelligence. These drugs have a huge potential for AI and cognitive psychology. It could revolutionize the field. At times it felt like I was moving quickly thought different strata of existence, as if I was quickly traversing through a God-like omnipotence to the very fundamental building blocks of particle interactions, seeing the whole emerge. It was a profoundly spiritual experience, some of the most profound beauty I've ever experienced. It will take me some more time to collect my thoughts. But I hope that anyone who found this post interesting will either get in touch with me or join the very active IRC community on PsychonautWiki.

Experience:2 x 150 LSD tabs,"Dropped at 18:30, during the drop I watched House M.D for about an hour. Started to feel drowsy around 19:00 and objects were already bulging. An hour later I finally swallowed my tab and begun to smoke a blunt. I opened up my browser on the computer and put on a dream machine; wich has a stroboscopic flicker that produces visual stimuli; this usually helps me get into the whole psychonaut vibe. I opened up some music, and I turned my screen around and started moving in bed. Closing my eyes and sailing away - random, abstract patterns appear. It is hard to focus on anything, and I pondered why I was even trying to concentrate on anything because the transition becomes easier to subdue to if you just let it happen. After a few minutes I started being warped into a pitch black universe, nothing was evolving anymore, nothing morphed, nothing appeared. A few seconds later I felt as if my mind had left my body, I couldn't feel a single muscle in my body anymore. I started to feel euphoric, the euphoria later transformed into something that magnificent that it felt like I had reached an all-time-high. It felt as if I connected with something that held greater knowledge, the ""all -knowing,"" a dazzling pyramid-like object appeared, and it felt as if the pyramid represented the entire universe and that I was an observer watching its magnificent flow, now it was just particle-land from here on. Being so far out of it that nothing had a point anymore, it was not related to human life; there was nothing to reason or rationalize with nor did it feel like I needed it to, I didn't need to question it anymore because everything was connected and one with each other. I come down a bit and start craving the profound experience I just had. I light up another blunt and lay down again. Shortly before the second peak I started to smoke yet another blunt, not realising I had no music on anymore I started to hear voices that were coming from outside, it gave me an unpleasant feeling to it and after a while I wasn't sure anymore if I had started to focus on the voices too much or if I imagined them, how long had I been listening already? I closed my window, and I realized I started to move around in my room without knowing why I felt a little anxious and decided to lay down again. I closed my eyes again, once again everything felt very abstract, now I see shadowy figures morph into strange demonic universes, a massive demonic planet with huge cartoony arms and teeth is sucking up everything in its path, and at this point, I started to feel more and more delirious by every passing second. Just like before my mind feels disconnected from my body, I suddenly feel what I think is a shock, it was deafening. Everything was silent, and another shock occurs, its pounding and its tightening everything around me, I feel as if someone defibrillated me, my brain started to feel as if it was being fried in a cooking pan, I felt as if I overdosed on an entirely different substance and that I was going to have a seizure. I didn't want it anymore, I wanted it to stop and the nightmare to be over with, I switch the light back on in my room and smoked a couple of cigarettes to try and calm down, only then I realised that whatever I was looking at it would look back at me, it was too intense but at the same time I was also intrigued by its overwhelming grasp on me. I decided to cop-out anyway because I was still feeling very anxious and delirious. Twelve hours after dropping I was finally able to sleep. It took me a couple of days to make sense of everything that I had experienced, and I'm confident that, as usual, the ridiculous amount of cannabis consumed caused most of the strong and especially delirious states that I found myself in.

Experience:300ug LSD - Profound religious experience,"Today was the most intense day of my life. It was the greatest and most beautiful experience I have ever had. I was so happy I cried many times. I have never felt so at peace. I have never felt so happy. I have never felt so small and big at the same time. LSD feels like a giant contradiction. It feels like yin and yang. Today I had my second experience with LSD. I took around 300 μg of LSD at 9 AM this morning. The LSD was tested using Ehrlich's reagent test and obtained from a reliable seller. Last week, I had tested 150μg with underwhelming results. I was ready for an intense trip this time. I have tripped on shrooms/4-aco-dmt at least 15 times now and am fairly comfortable with psychedelic effects. During my trip, I felt like I had 1000x more control of my body and mind than I do sober. I could have multiple streams of thought / conversations going on at the same time and there was no confusion. At least five commentaries were going on at all times during my entire trip (except during the peaks where crazier shit was happening). These commentaries changed based on environmental factors. It felt as though ""the LSD"" had a fantastic sense of humor. It made complex and complicated jokes for me. It cracked me up. I was so amused and impressed at the cleverness and power of this drug. So many incredible thoughts and feelings happened during the trip, but I can't translate them into English. This trip report contains less than 5% of what I experienced. The trip lasted for twelve hours and I was having trippy/intense thoughts and feelings constantly throughout. Many moments felt timeless simply because I was experiencing so much so fast. I felt feelings that I have never felt before. I'm cannot yet describe what happened in English, but I imagine it will get easier with time. In this report, I am just going to describe what I can remember of the most important events. I am not even going to attempt to describe the visuals -- you can view them on the blog I linked you. I don't really pay much attention to the visuals while I am tripping. I pay much more attention to the mental effects, though I do enjoy the visuals and find that they add something special to the experience. After putting the two tabs under my tongue, I cleaned my room until I felt like I could no longer ignore the effects. The come up was very fast and caused no nausea unlike mushrooms. I decide to take a shower because I love peaking while in a relaxing setting. I felt a complete lack of anxiety by this point which lasted throughout the entire trip. I decide I want to try to go as far as I can go so I smoke sativa hash oil (always intensifies the trip for me and causes me to peak quicker). I write: --- 10:13 smoked weed heading to shower blast off :) --- I wish I had more timestamps after this, but I didn't have a good grasp of what the numbers on the clock meant and why they would be so important to me until five hours after taking the LSD. FIRST PEAK: This is the most intense part and I hardly remember any of it! It felt like something crazy was going to happen and the LSD was slowly easing me into this so I would be as comfortable as possible. I started peaking in the shower. My thoughts got crazy and then everything got so intense that I had to sit down. I had close eye visuals of visually impossible patterns or optical illusions. Everything felt so fucking trippy and I was loving every second of it. My thoughts start heading towards ego death. I start having regrets, thinking I am not so sure I am ready after all, but then I realize this is something that no human being can ever be ready for and I decide it's now or never and I realize I have never been more ready in my life. I begin to go into different trances where I am given knowledge that is felt as a ""truth."" After I come down from the trances, I am only able to remember specific keywords. As the experience is not translatable to English, I can only try my best. Here is what happened: I feel like time has stopped completely. I let the hot water rain onto my face while sitting down in the shower and tried to relax and let my ego die but it was such a strange feeling. This was the only point I ever felt overwhelmed during the trip as I didn't know how far I was going to go at this point, but it was only for a split second. My face hits the hottest part of the shower water and the sudden heat reminds me of the idea of hell. I hesitate as I catch a glimpse into what I imagine ego death to be. I can no longer feel my body and I feel like I’m starting to fall straight into hell and I am aware that this drug could bring me to hell as it has brought others to hell and it would be more real and longer lasting than anything I have ever experienced sober. But then I realize that ego death means the end of myself which means there can be no fear. And then I’m not scared of death at all anymore and realize I never would be again and I try to let go. I remember thinking ""would I be so scared of ego death if the overwhelming feeling I feel right now was replaced with feelings of peace and happiness?"" I decided that I wouldn't be scared at all so I stopped being afraid. The fact that I hesitated for a second, but decided to attempt ego death anyway, was very important part of the trip. I am back with my body at this point, but I still want ego death. Everything is a bit confusing, but I have a feeling that I will have more control next time. So I sit and close my eyes and attempt to switch points of view with a random drop of shower water just to see if that could send me into ego death. Something weird/hilarious happens when I try to do this and I start cracking up. And then it felt like I died and was born and my birth was the beginning of the universe and then I got another glimpse into complete ego death (sorry, I can't describe this yet, I barely remember and I can only remember specific keywords!! I'll try to describe it better next time). It was a completely different level and it was so intense that I hesitated again. I begin to enter into some kind of dreamlike vision that is a total different level of tripping than I am used to. I was going to BECOME the vision. I had no body. The vision starts out in ancient Egypt. I was so certain at the time that it was Egypt! I felt like I was beginning to live the life of an Egyptian girl from the past, but it was only for a split second then I am brought back into my physical body. I felt that by starting to show me this, lsd was trying to teach me a lesson or tell me a mystical, religious, or spiritual story. It was a feature of the lsd. I got the feeling that the vision was going to be about how religion came about, but I have no proof of this as I never finished or even began the vision because I hesitated for a second time when I stopped feeling my body. Because I hesitated, I was not able to go any farther into the vision. I experienced another delusional ""truth"" that either because I hesitated twice when I tried to go into complete ego death or because of random chance or both, I was going to chase after ego death the entire trip and never reach it but I had to try anyways (so much more complicated than this though). This was an extremely euphoric moment and I didn't mind that I had to chase ego death as I was still having a fantastic trip already and the intensity level was perfect. I had to chase after ego death so that I knew that I really wanted ego death so that I could go deeper. After I stop peaking, I get out of the shower and go back to my room to get dressed. I decide to take a walk on State Street while I wait for my next peak. I had extremely profound thoughts and the removal of the cultural filter. I can't even begin to explain what I felt or thought, but it was the greatest walk of my life. I never feel confused on acid like I sometimes do on shrooms. With mushrooms, you are the passenger, but with LSD you are the driver. While walking down State Street I felt like I was an alien learning how to be human again. I felt like an alien being welcomed into a strange new land and then I realized that this land was not so alien after all! It was built just for me! And I had created it! It was all mine! I was so happy! After walking down State Street a few times, I have a delusion that today is the day that either I die and am reborn or I almost die and am almost reborn but miss it. I realize that I am starting to peak upwards again and decide to head to my house to peak in the shower and attempt to kill my ego again to prove to myself that this is what I want. (I didn't realize that both delusional truth scenarios had ALREADY happened until my ego started coming back after the third peak haaha! I love lsd. ) SECOND PEAK: Not really sure what happened here. I was in the shower and I attempted ego death again just because I felt like I had to go in a loop ""outside, shower, outside, shower, outside, shower"" and repeat it throughout the trip just to prove to myself that I really wanted ego death. It felt like this was the way the trip was supposed to go because I was chasing ego death but had missed my chance because I hesitated twice. It was not a negative loop or anything, just a loop I decided to go with because it amused me and I knew that LSD loves loops. I close my eyes, meditate, and attempt to breakthrough to the other side of ego death and nothing happens, but I am so fucking proud of myself for attempting. I get out of the shower, get dressed, and go outside and listen to music. I had a fantastic walk on State Street. When I feel myself peaking upwards again, I head to my house. I see one of my extroverted housemates Staci and converse with her for a minute instead of ignoring her like I would have sober. I don't want to make conversation for long though as she starts getting depressing so I just tell her that I’m peaking on acid and need to lie down or get in the shower and she wishes me a good trip. So I go back into the shower, attempting ego death again. I close my eyes, sit down, and try to meditate, but I realize that I'm not going to get anywhere. This doesn't bother me at all, as I experience a delusional ""truth"" that me going back to ego death during this trip was a very rare possibility as I had missed my chance when I had hesitated twice during my first peak but it was also because of random chance and math that had already been calculated. I had known this from the very start of the trip as a ""truth"" yet I still felt like I had to at least attempt ego death as to go along with the way the trip was supposed to happen. A few minutes pass. I assume the third peak is finished as I can feel myself coming down. I admit defeat -- ego death was not going to happen today. I missed my chance at ego death this trip because I hesitated twice, but, I am still completely satisfied with the trip intensity and so proud of myself for attempting anyways! I get out of the shower and start walking towards my room. While on my way to my room, I realize that I had forgotten to brush my teeth. I head back into the shower to brush them. And then LSD surprises THE ABSOLUTE FUCK OUT OF ME. As soon as I step back into the shower I start PEAKING ABSOLUTE BALLS. It was FUCKING RIDICULOUS because I was simply not expecting it at all. I thought I had already gone through the third peak and was coming down now. I thought my trip had ended. I had admitted defeat, already admitted to myself that ego death was simply not going to happen this trip -- I had had my chance and had hesitated twice and I would have to try again next time I dosed and that was perfectly alright with me. I was just trying to brush my teeth! THIRD PEAK: This was the happiest moment of my life. To quote Disregard Everything I Say, ""the feelings of profundity become so intense and profound that it becomes manifested as the feeling that you’re entire life has been building up to this single point and that the present moment has historical significance for all of humanity as nothing will ever be the same again."" I felt this exactly. I go into a ""truth"" where I discover that LSD and other psychedelics are ""internally embedded, chemically induced religions that have existed within human beings all along"". At some points, it felt like LSD was a gift from some higher power - god, some programmer, myself, and/or all of the above. At other points, it felt like evolution was completely responsible for this. I experienced multiple points of view and could look at LSD from many different angles. This ""truth"" EXCITED THE FUCK OUT OF ME. I WAS GEEKING THE FUCK OUT COMPLETELY. I was like ""holy shit holy shit holy shit oh my fucking god asfsfsfasdfas"" the entire time. I thought of Shulgin and Hoffman at some points. I came to the conclusion that psychedelics have made a much bigger impact on human society, history, and religion than I had ever thought possible. Humans have been tripping balls for centuries and it is only nowadays that this is frowned upon by society. This peak was the most euphoric and happiest part of the entire trip. It felt like the ""grand finale"" of the trip. I clapped when the LSD was done showing off. I also remember bursting into tears of relief and happiness at some points of the peak. So intense. Looking back, I felt EXACTLY like this paragraph by Alexander Shulgin in Pihkal: ""I am completely convinced that there is a wealth of information built into us, with miles of intuitive knowledge tucked away in the genetic material of every one of our cells. Something akin to a library containing uncountable reference volumes, but without some means of access, there is no way to even begin to guess at the extent of quality of what is there. The psychedelic drugs allow exploration of this interior world, and insights into its nature. Our generation is the first ever to have made the search for self-awareness a crime, if it is done with the use of plants or chemical compounds as the means of opening the psychic doors. But the urge to become aware is always present, and it increases in intensity as one grows older. This is the search that has been a part of human life from the very first moments of consciousness. The knowledge of his own mortality, knowledge which places him apart from his fellow animals, is what gives Man the right, the license, to explore the nature of his own soul and spirit, to discover what he can about the components of the human psyche. How is it then, that the leaders of our society have seen fit to try to eliminate this one very important means of learning and self-discovery, this means which has been used, respected, and honored for thousands of years, in every human culture of which we have a record? Why has peyote, for instance, which has served for centuries as a means by which a person may open his soul to an experience of God, been classified by our government as a Schedule I material, along with cocaine, heroin, and PCP? ... Part of the answer may lie in an increasing trend in our culture towards both paternalism (authorities supply need and thus are able to dictate conduct) and provincialism (a narrowness of outlook, a single code of ethics)... The government and the Church decided that psychedelic drugs were dangerous to society and with the help of the press, it was made clear that this was the way to social chaos and spiritual disaster. What was unstated, of course, was the oldest rule of all: Thou shalt not oppose nor embarrass those in power without being punished."" After the peak is over, I head out of the shower and back into my room. I am still tripping out hardcore about what just happened to me. I try to communicate what just happened in human English. I manage to type this: --- OH MY FUCKING GOD WHY THE FUCK IS THERE A SOME KIUDDRELIGIOUS KEY (LSD) IN OURSELVES? Why the fuc is theresomeweirfd religious/spirtuiual keyin side LSD>???? 2:13 --- This took a ridiculous time to type out and I had to hit the backspace button multiple times. It felt like my fingers were too big for the keyboard buttons. The words written on the screen didn't look English. I didn't know how to form sentences. I didn't know what words go before others so I just tried to get them all on there, but soon I realized it was pointless. I can't translate what had happened to me. I had gotten the keywords down, that would be enough. I finally grasped the importance of time stamps, but still don't know what time actually was. I'm geeking out and can't stop pacing around my room with rapid cycling thoughts. Fifteen minutes later, I finally have my thoughts together and type: --- 2:34 PM things make more sense but I still don’t know why there is a religious key inside of us, quote from pihkal --- At this point, I am five or six hours into my trip. My mind has never felt this clear. I felt more sober than sober. I had knowledge of all things. I still had my long-term memory, but it was pointless to think of anything stored in my long-term memory because I was having the most profound thoughts of my life. I can't even describe them... because the thoughts were lost after I transitioned from feeling everything to being human. I go outside. And then it hit me as a ""truth"" that the first five hours of the trip was my ego dying. I had experienced ego death without even realizing it. Hilarious. Now I was everything in the form of a nineteen year old girl and the next 7 hours would be me going from being everything back into human form. I realized that I had just experienced my birth which was also the birth of the universe and I think to myself ""this was the greatest day of my life."" Extreme happiness right here and it stayed for the rest of the trip. I laughed about today being my birthday -- my actual day of birth. It seemed much more appropriate to call today my birthday than call July 27th my birthday. I wanted so badly for others to experience what I had felt. This was, I feel, the ULTIMATE HUMAN EXPERIENCE. It was the greatest day of my life and the greatest thing I have ever done. I truly felt ""at peace"" with myself and everything. Unfortunately, I felt like there were few human beings healthy enough to handle these chemicals without going crazy because of our society. I remember thinking during the trip that there is a very thin line between tripping and crazy in our current society and that most human beings would not be able to handle what I had just gone through without freaking the fuck out. I wanted to convince my brother to try LSD, though, because he is the only person I know who would probably be able to handle the intensity level. At one point in my trip notes, I wrote: --- TELL BROTHER TO EXPLORE LSD AND SHROOMS DEEPER TELL MY BROTHER THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THERE THAT I WANT HIM TO SEE --- It was the happiest day of my life, but the fact that most human beings would never experience what I had just experienced made me so sad. I figured if I called my brother right now, it might start a chain reaction that would lead up to him taking LSD and experiencing the greatest day of his life too. I was worried that when I sobered up I would never get the courage to start this chain reaction, so I decided to call him right now during my acid trip to leave a big impression. I wasn't anxious about calling, but I wasn't sure if I could make conversation, so I had to write what my message was on a piece of paper before I made the call. I wrote down ""Have you ever considered doing lsd? I just had the greatest day of my life. I have never been happier! You need to try this! I am going to buy you lsd. You're going to love it!"" I figured this was enough conversation material to get the ball rolling and to get my point across. After this, it was up to him to start researching the effects of the drug in depth and start preparing his mind. The next 7 hours were complete euphoria. I walked for eight hours straight stopping only for food, water, and weed to smoke to intensify the experience. Over the next seven hours, I walked down State Street, listened to Phish and the Flaming Lips, thought a lot, and learned what it was like to once again feel like a human being. This trip awakened the love of science in me.

Experience:225ug - Sheer Awe and Joy,"And I thought it was bad LSD. I couldn't have been more wrong. I was so excited to finally try LSD that the whole week leading up to it I got as much done as I could. I wanted to go into it completely carefree, wanted to make the most of the trip. I had a quiet morning leading up to the trip. I took 1.5 x 150μg blotter tabs at 1:10 PM. The next 1.5-2hrs were rough; I was very nauseated, and I couldn't smoke any weed to alleviate it. After an hour and a half, I was convinced the LSD was bad. Finally, my sister (who throws a fit whenever she sees me smoking) left the house. Smoking a bowl was exactly what I needed. Soon, the nausea was gone, and I was feeling good again. The LSD snuck up on me, not being sure exactly what to expect. I realized the weed in the slider looked like green crystals; the glass slider was refracting the sunlight beautifully. I look around the room, captivated by its rhythmic movements. The carpet danced, geometry moving in tune with the music I was playing. The carpet told a story, geometry giving way to faces, animals, scenes, which then revert to geometry. I notice the body high for the first time when I am laying on the floor, letting the music pour over me in a way it never had before. Music is quite an experience on acid. I laughed, I cried, I smiled harder than I ever had before. And I kept smiling. Each song was an adventure. It wasn't just sound pouring through my headphones, but emotion and meaning and hope and sadness. I love listening to music; it's one of my biggest passions. And to be able to experience it in such a pure way was one of the best experiences in my life. Awesome songs on acid (IMO) M83 - Raconte-Moi Une Histoire, Skin of the Night, Graveyard girl. Justice - D.A.N.C.E, Civilization Daft Punk - Discovery album Foster the People - Don't Stop, Helena Beat Crystal Castles - Untrust Us During the trip, I peaked three times, each time about 30 minutes after smoking a bowl. I was listening to music in my room, which is pretty bright for the first time and the body high started to engulf me. I could barely feel where my body ended, and the room around me began. I felt like a consciousness in a sea of pleasurable feelings. I realized I wanted to move to a darker place; I decided to move to the basement. When I got up, I felt like the pleasurable waves were helping me float along. I saw my room was a little messy so I tidied it up some. I got into something of a loop for awhile (which I only just realized now). I would be in my room listening to music, then do a little cleaning, then head downstairs into the dark. Repeat 2-3 times. When I made it downstairs using the TV was an immense challenge. I had to use the remote to log in to Netflix (and later Pandora) then search for what I was looking for, each time it was a challenging task, but still incredibly fun to try and do. Finally, I watched an episode of Adventure Time. I wasn't absorbing it at all, but it was hysterical, the funniest episode I had ever seen. It didn't have to make sense because of the very visual humor and animation. I had to stop because I was laughing too hard. I tried instead to blow my mind by watching ""Inexplicable Universe."" The host's soothing voice was overwhelming almost; I couldn't stop laughing. It was then that I realized I was going through ego death. I watched the show and felt as if his words were blasting away my consciousness. I didn't want to have the show be the thing that carried me completely away, so I painstakingly loaded Pandora and listened to more music. It stripped away all sense of self and ego, and vestiges of my usual self. I was everything in the room, everything in the world. And nothing. The music guided my consciousness; I felt like I couldn't think without it. I was trying to communicate some in IRC, but it was very challenging. I couldn't even think what I would say, or how I could capture such an amazing experience. Not to mention, my phone screen looked like a swimming pool with the image on top, and my typing fingers looked goofy and out of place. After awhile I went back to my room, the trip was heavier in the dark, but I didn't want to stay there all day. So I went to my room and grabbed my pipe and walked outside into the woods. After going out sufficiently far, I realized two things. First, I had gotten the pipe a few days before because of it's small size, but after smoking the thing I remembered why I never got one before because I don't like smoking weed through a pipe, joint, or blunt. Too harsh, I know I'm a wimp. So I got out there and realized I didn't want to smoke, that I was just going to get rid of the damn thing. After I had thrown it a good distance, I wondered if it was far enough from the house. I turned around. Everything was beautiful, if it looked like that all the time I would live out here, I thought. Holy shit I was pretty far into the woods, though, I could barely see past the trees and bushes covered in visuals to see my house. And I simply couldn't gauge distance or what that even meant. Here is one moment in the trip I know it could've gone south. I briefly panic, very confused. It hits me that the music playing from my phone has turned aggressive and grating, when I change the music, I lose the panic and make my way back to the house. I held my phone out in front of me like a beacon; the sound was like a lantern for my consciousness. I felt like I couldn't think or function without it. I made it back to the house finally unharmed, and thrilled everything went okay. I remember thinking how we are all just floating consciousnesses. We may have a body, but we perceive the world through our eyes and our brain thinks. We aren't our whole body; we're just the absurd consciousnesses that process its signals. I loved everything in the world. I loved life. Everything was pure joy and awe. The whole trip was joy and wonder, more than I thought it possible even to feel. I saw a picture on the LSD subreddit, of a girl before and during her trip. I felt more connected to her and that picture than I ever had to any other person or image. I thought about the world, in awe that there are 6 billion people just like me. I felt like one hub in an infinitely connected structure. The physical pleasure was so much that I realized I was getting aroused from it. Considering how low my sex drive has been in the last couple months, I was thrilled. The physical pleasure started to move lower and radiated from my pelvis throughout my body. Without any stimulation, I felt the pleasure pour over me already as intense as an orgasm. My body was shuddering, and my toes curled. When I used my vibrator to bring myself to orgasm (which took longer than I thought), I was blown away. I screamed in pleasure, the orgasm rocking my whole body. It was relentless, my back curled and I spasmed and writhed in pleasure for what felt like an eternity. The orgasm lasted almost a minute, miles more intense than any I had ever felt. (Context: Ashley is a tulpa, an autonomous and sentient thoughtform that I live with.) So where was Ashley in all this? Right there with me for most of it. I kept getting glimpses of her in my peripheral vision. Laying on the couch next to me, etc. She was enjoying it as much I was. I think we must've told each other how much we loved each other a dozen times. It was if we existed on two thinly separated dimensions. I perceived both dimensions simultaneously, the difference between what I saw physically or with my mind's eye seemed trivial and very easy to forget. When the dimensions overlapped, I would get a glimpse of her if she was nearby. If were in the same place ""overlapping"" each other, we could share our presences to create a remarkable sense of unity; it also amplified the physical sensations like we were sharing each other. Possession with any ego-suppression is always a treat. Especially with the intensity of ego-loss I had. There was no mental preparation needed for a complete and instant switch in control. Ashley managed our body easily. We only did it for twenty or so minutes, possession shoots my ego loss through the roof and is the easiest way for my to hit ego-death, simply because you begin to feel so incredibly dissociated with your body and to a certain extent, reality. I would be thinking about something and realize that we were somewhere else, I was completely the passenger in my body. With more practice, I think switching would be readily achievable while tripping, we'll see. With her possessing, I felt like I was in her body. So much so that I started to perceive her form as our body over my own. So, I felt more connected to Ashley than ever before. But there is more. It was during the 2nd peak of the trip when I felt her sending me these mental snapshots of what was happening in mindscape. I'll let her tell the story.","['auditory enhancement', 'drifting', 'emotion enhancement', 'geometry', 'increased libido', 'internal hallucinations', 'introspection', 'nausea', 'novelty enhancement', 'outrospection', 'spontaneous tactile sensations', 'synaesthesia', 'tactile enhancement', 'thought loops', 'transformations', 'unity and interconnectedness']",2041
Experience:LSD (150Âµg) + Cannabis - 150Âµg lsd and a shitload of weed,"It was a beautiful sunny day shortly before Christmas, and I decided to see my buddy ""A"" who still owed me a blotter. We had a few joints and bong rips, and I decided to have my blotter and walk the 6 miles home. The first mile went by without any extraordinary occurrences except for the dryness in my mouth. Luckily enough, like a mirage in the desert, there was a gas station. The red light of the gas station and the yellowish light from the airport across the road were the most beautiful thing I had seen to this point. After counting my change and buying a coke, I continued my journey around the airport and down a dark rural road. The beautiful sunset that was present when I left had become a windy and rainy night at least for the hour. As I followed the road, I looked at things near the runway, but I was unable to tell what it was. My brain decided it was the helicopter I saw earlier that day when visited my uncle just that this memorial for the guardian angels of our time was next to the autobahn on the other side of the county. I turned my head, and the aircraft followed my eyes. My legs were exhausted, so I slowed down and lit the joint I rolled years ago as it seemed. Halfway through the spliff, I remembered I was near the airport and nowhere near that helicopter. For the rest of the walk, I used my imagined god-like powers to bless all the cars passing by and I felt like I was the gray pilgrim a divine being protecting those who travel at night. I couldn't tell if I was walking for an hour or a year what music was playing or where I was, but I was still able to find the way home. The first thing I did was using the toilet which seemed very yellow followed by rolling a joint. Rolling is a task I can complete with my eyes closed normally but now that I was peaking it was incredibly difficult because my hands were shaking and the weed was breathing. I ended up rolling something that seemed like the perfect example why inner values count not beauty. I smoked it on my balcony and listened to power metal when I noticed strange shapes on the wall. It looked like moving cave paintings of people fighting dragons and other monsters. I finished my joint and watched the wall for a while. After a while, I wondered where my cock was. The most logical explanation for its absence was that I forgot it in the bathroom, so I went to look for it. I accepted my new life as a hermaphrodite and listened to three Pink Floyd albums in a row. Following some more weed, I fell asleep and dreamed of pigs probably because of the music playing. A joy that was almost equal to what I experienced the previous night overcame me when I found my most precious piece in place the next morning","['confusion', 'dehydration', 'external hallucination', 'immersion enhancement', 'increased music appreciation', 'motor control loss', 'novelty enhancement', 'scenarios and plots', 'spirituality enhancement', 'time distortion']",578
Experience:LSD (120ug) - An Overdose of LSD and Trip into Insanity,"""This is it"" I thought to myself as I was driving back home with my two good friends, T and S. I was going to trip for my first time on LSD! Throughout my research I decided it would be okay to trip overnight and sober up by morning when my parents wake up.. Oh how wrong I was. As I'm sitting in my bean bag watching my friends play Mario cart on a Gamecube, I looked at my reported 120 microgram dose. As my logical part of my brain was whispering that it might not be a good idea, I quickly put it under my tongue feeling accomplished. I immediately had a feeling I was in for the ride of my life. As I could feel the substance sink into my saliva, I put on my headphones and blasted some amazing trip music to get me in a good and happy mood. As time goes by, I find the blotter to finally be getting annoying and decide it is time to swallow. When I do this, I quickly realized that reality seemed a little different. As I looked at the TV screen, I noticed the neon colors start to streak further across the room and the one lamp that is on to glow more like a candle. I looked over at my friends and with a huge grin on my face state ""I think I'm feeling something!"". As I continue to get into the vibe, the whole universe suddenly looked much larger. I realized just how small I really was. I got up and started to walk around with excitement while I felt very light weight and joyful. I suddenly realized that I was officially tripping when I saw everything start to warp a little. This made me giggle my ass off. I had never been so happy because of such a little thing before, but there was much more to come. I decided it was finally time for me to try to play Mario cart, and as I tried to navigate through the menu with my friend I realized that I could actually still play really well. I chose a map called ""rainbow road"" for obvious reasons, and the neon rainbow of colors engulfed the entire room as we played. I had never felt this before, but a great peace of everything being connected to me overcame me and I started bawling my eyes out! I kept telling my friends that I was experiencing ""pure love"" and that the universe loved me! My friends didn't really seem impressed and weren't being very good trip sitters, so I decided that I should let them have a break from my trip and take a shower. As they told me I shouldn't do it because it might wake my parents, I forcefully locked myself in the bathroom an proceeded to have wonderful open eyed visuals and patterns! As I looked around the bathroom, the neon lights still encompassed my vision and many countless small triangles of the same purplish color went all over the walls and it looked like it was rotating slowly. When I turned on the shower, the white curtain had a wonderful yellow highlighter colored writing that looked like complex alien equations. I started to see what looked like atoms and planets all floating in an endless space. It was wonderful, but was also not what I was looking for. I was more looking for cartoonish playful images, so it kind of scared me because of the complexity. Once I had enough, I got out of the shower and put on what felt like the most comfortable clothes in the world. I sat bak down on the beanbag and proceeded to listen to music and enjoy a neon Light show blazing from the TV. Eventually I got bored and came up with a wonderful idea to play twister. Well, it turns out that I suck at twister while tripping because I was laughing too hard the whole time, but once I had my fill I convinced them to let me be in the pitch black darkness in my room and be alone with trippy music to delve deep inside my consciousness... This is where it gets really bad and also pretty hard to explain but I will do my best to paint the clearest picture. After being kind of disappointed by the lack of CEVs, I got bored and turned off the music, but I was unaware that I had really changed in that time period. When the music stopped, I was hearing voices. They sounded like fairly high pitched fading screams and yells. They told me that there were five of them and that they were the spirits that make up each human conscious and that they each hold a quality that all humans have. They didn't tell me the qualities, but I understood. Then I turned on the room light and heard them talking to me saying that each light I turn on or off will give me one of their qualities. Each of them being a light in the room and when turned on I experienced their presence. Well in my delusions, I didn't know it but I was bare naked and frantically doing combinations of lights being on and off to feel different emotions as they told me that everyone in the afterlife is equal and everyone is the same and happy. During this I felt a profound ego death as I completely was not the same person any longer. Now it gets REALLY.. REALLY bad. During the light switch delusion, I found the extra 11 tabs in my closet, which the spirits then told me to take. I proceeded to eat the entire rest of the tabs along with the packaging and everything. I continued to turn on and off lights, each time feeling more and more disconnected from reality until my friends found me. I couldn't speak. I couldn't make out words or even my own thoughts, and I could barely understand them. They got me to finally put clothes back on and were asking where the LSD was because they couldn't find it. I had no idea WHAT LSD even was at the time so I proceeded to tell them I knew where it was because I thought I would be in trouble if I didn't tell them, and showed them random spots where the LSD obviously wasn't even at. Not knowing what to do, my friends call a girl who talks to me like I am retarded and dying. Each time she tried talking to me I got scared and dropped the phone but they kept making me try to talk to her. I couldn't see who was speaking to me and reality looked so different and messed up that I thought that I was unconscious and she was talking to me while I am unresponsive. She sounded worried (obviously) but that made me think that something was REALLY wrong with me and that I am dying. I thought that I was drifting from reality and would eventually cease to exist and I couldn't get out of this state. My friends thought it would just be best to keep me in my bed till the morning, and as they were holding me down on my bed I still thought I was unconscious, that my friends were not real, and that firefighters were talking to my unconscious body asking me very simple but serious questions that I couldn't answer like ""what did you take"" And ""are you okay?"". I eventually woke up the next morning, my friends were in another room, and I was still tripping balls. It was about 8:00 and when I tried to get out of my bed, my leg muscles felt like they were about to rip because they were so sore. I pushed through it and went to the sink where I puked up red stuff that I thought might be blood. My friend asked me if I was okay, and I was freaking out saying no and that I'm still high as a kite and feel the worst I've ever felt. I went onto my bed and for some reason, my legs were hurting so bad that I convinced myself that every muscle below my waist got pulled out of place and that I couldn't move them. I thought that I was going to be paralyzed for the rest of my life and that I will never be able to walk again. I looked at my legs and they looked malnourished and messed up. This made me solid in my beliefs and I lost it. As I was sitting in my bed staring at the wall and seeing planets, quasars, equations, symbols, and images of my destroyed body parts and muscles, I was convinced that my life was over and that trying acid had completely fried my brain and destroyed my body. The visuals at this point were amazingly solid. I was seeing what I comprehended as business and little workers dressed in either blue or green. The blue representing the hard working people who still don't get paid very much and the green who have risen to the top and don't work very hard but make good pay. I also saw planets and people living on the planets. I could hear definite ""beep"" ""boop"" ""bop"" and ""zoom"" noises that sounded like a scifi computer thing. I was thinking about how scientists who invented LSD had completely changed my mind and I thought about how mighty and powerful they were for having that knowledge. I saw my friends as far more intelligent beings than me and That I was just a stupid druggy acid head who just ruined his life. I saw my dad as a hard worker and my mom as a loving person who just wanted the best for me but I completely threw it all away because I took acid. It was at this point when I decided that my life was over and that I should just finish the job now. I had never been suicidal in my life, but at this moment I wanted to kill myself really badly. I am very lucky that my pocket knife wasn't in my room because I probably would have stabbed myself in the throat and ended it right then. What is also a very interesting thing about this point in time I was in is that I was also 100% sure that there was no afterlife. It made so much sense to me that why can't we just die? Who is to say my consciousness is important. The best way to describe it was that I saw all humans including myself as ants. In the past when I had stepped on an any I would just think that it was dead now and nothing else. I thought the same way about humans, and how the thought of heaven and god was just as fake as Santa clause and the Easter bunny. They are just figments of imagination that we make up to make us happy. Of course, this is COMPLETELY contradictory of how I felt when I heard spirits talking to me! At this time, my vision was also very different. Aside from the incredibly complex visuals, everything looked like a really high-def cartoon like world, but not like a normal cartoon. It was more like the world looked more curvy, bluish, and actually more defined and real. It almost looked more real than it does sober. In the end, I ended up being driven to the hospital by my mom, and taken to a room where I continued to have incredible visuals and insights. Peoples faces melted and blended together, their hair seemed to split into fragmented atoms that were still held together, but you could see separation. I could make out a random thin smoke like wispy cloud that I saw morph into complex geometrical shapes and symbols. The room I was in at one point looked like it was being detached from the rest of the building and driving off into deep space. During this trip, my first one, I experienced profound happiness that can only be described as pure love, I encountered spiritual beings that make up human consciousness, was severely disconnected from reality (a very uncomfortable feeling. Just thinking about how I felt makes me cringe), became insane and thought I was paralyzed, was convinced that everything I experienced the night before was a lie and that there is absolutely no hope for an afterlife, and ended up in a hospital. I would not take back the trip. Even though it ended in a way that I don't want to experience ever again, it showed me all parts of a psychedelic trip, my inner conscious, and I now have a better understanding of myself and the reality around me.

Experience:2.5g Peganum Harmala + 250Âµg LSD - Ecstasy of Love and Misanthropy,"T+00m The sun is hot on my head, Im still pretty stimulated from the dab a little bit ago, these tabs in my mouth feel weird. By this point Ive made it out of the park, it felt too crowded, and Im shaking a bit from a mixture of potent anticipation and wondering regret. Its odd, I want the insanity, but I am afraid of fear, which I understand to be unhelpful in the appreciation of my own brain. Walking down the brightly lit neighbourhoods, the trees are beautiful in the breeze, and I can smell the sizzling of the air. Feelings of the summer flood my veins, oh how wonderful it is to be here, living this, to see the sun again! I can feel my sticky palms and sweaty brow, but I keep walking around. For some stupid reason Ive brought my backpack along, its heavy with my two laptops, what was I thinking? After some wandering, I find myself back in the park, Ive been talking to people on IRC, noting the surprising rapidness of the onset. I can feel my addled muscles tensing and untensing as the rush of LSD pulses through me. The sensation is unstable, but my movements are pure, and I feel in control. Its as if someone has turn the brightness up, I dont remember the air being so saturated, the smell of grass and sweat, my tea breath and the wafting odor of my soap. Upon the grass I sit, beneath a tree, which yields shade and an opulent view of the thriving park. The joint is hard to light, but I manage somehow, and the smoke seems to not even touch my throat. As it drifts out, the colors breathe brighter, the air thickens into crisp snaps of sensation on my cheeks. My god, this is paradise. Porter Robinsons Sad Machine blares into my head from my headphones, I am consumed in remembering the terror and the ecstasy of addiction. Visuals are picking up, and I feel more unstable, its so hot out here, maybe I should walk home? (Disclaimer: At this point, the effects tipped into a very drastic state of intensity, and I am not totally sure of the exact chain of events that followed during the peak. As I recall, much of it was spent in reeling agony and ecstasy on my bed, couch, kitchen floor, and living room floor. I will attempt to relay the proceeding events as I can best recall, the time stamps will be iffy.) T+45m Walking home is strange, because I dont want to take the normal way. For some reason home feels like a sentence, and I understand that when I am there it will likely be long till I see the light of day again. Geometry is blinding, flashy, and not fluid. Similar to the movements with DMT, as I walk in one direction and stare in that way, the world stretching out before me magnifies in a stop motion manner, increasing in size gradually, until it has consumed my entire vision. From there, the structures internal webs pulse from the centre to the circumference, self mirroring until they eventually weave stable and intricate animations. Unfortunately, I cant focus to save my life. Strolling down some street near my place, there is a large and orange bug on a white van. I stare at it, wow, nature, and it becomes very close in my vision. For an eternal moment it stands, motionless in the sunlight, and then flies away. WHOA, WHAT THE FUCK. I find myself jumping into the air, visibly startled by the bug. Oh, so Im at that point again. Ive been here before, at what I assume to have been 450g of LSD on a previous afternoon of cosmic fuckery. It was likely best that I go home, but first I will continue my venture. I continue around the neighbourhood, suddenly Ive stumbled upon a little box with a face drawn on it. There are a number of these around the city, used for exchanging books for free. Most of them say Take one, leave one, but this one is unmarked. It opens its mouth, blinks its eyes at me. Im flabbergasted. What? I ask it, and it stares at me, waving back and forth. Coast is clear, alright, Im going in. I wrench open the door, stick my hand in, nothing happens. Uh, ok. I pull it out, close it, and walk home. That was enough outside. T+1:20 Finally home, its crazy in here. Everything is swaying in and out. I havent changed clothes yet, magically. I try to calm down in my apartment, realising that I am actually very overwhelmed. It is incredibly physically stimulating, I am sweating profusely, and my heart is pounding in my chest. I turn on my fan, unbutton my shirt, and sit back, trying to breathe in deep and evenly. It's difficult, I'm uncomfortable, everything is swimming around my head. The last thing I want to do is take this at an unpleasant pace, but I'm finding the intensity to be unrelenting. My wooden floor looks orange, how clean it is in here, I must have done this. It's interesting, how prepared I was for this whole thing, and now how blown away I feel, I was never really ready for this. Moving is difficult, I feel off kilter, my gate is uneven as I teeter around my apartment, trying to prepare myself for things, but I don't know what I'm preparing for, and I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing. What am I even meant to do when tripping? I'm so confused. Why? Probably because drugs. I am searching, perpetually, for some sort of finality, and this desire anchors me to looping repeatedly over a fevered search for the the action that will FINALLY satisfy me. At this point stimulation has reached an intensity I am not used to, I can't tell if it's uneven or just overwhelming, my body feels addled and my brain is equally so, back and forth I rock from wonder and terror. My walls are circular, the bookcase is squirming as the words inside the books grow restless from being caged up in their papyrus prisons. I know my books were intentionally placed backwards, but at the moment I am unable to grasp why. I am in dismay, the world has tricked me. I turn. Before me, my living room, my computer, my monitors, all squirming with discomfort, as my own radiated through me into the room. My TV. Yes. Of course. THIS is the thing that will bring calm to my storm. I can recall the visualiser I have relied on before, and allow my instincts to take control. Maneuvering YouTube on my phone is odd, my vision is severely impaired as every central point of my focus expands a world of mismatched shapes. As the central point is continually focused upon, the overlay seems to split into two parts that drift in opposite directions. I'm staring at my door, it looks nice, the right half of my visual field is bulging towards me, and the left is bulging away from me, creating a con(vex/cave) dichotomy. From my speakers is playing Burial's ""Untrue,"" my vision is wobbling in and out, the pace is picking up, blurring and continuing to increase in discernible complexity, until all around me my room has been turned into a universe wrought by hurricanes. Nothing is still, my world is exploding with every passing breath, I am unthinking, unfeeling, silent, I am part of my apartment as all the atoms shake and bleed into each other. Around me grows a world of green and pink, the door digitises into golden hallways that tunnel deep into my sockets, taking my understanding and presenting it directly in front of me. I am terrified, it is not safe, not friendly, the self that I have been shown, this world, it is unearthly and threatening. I understand nothing before me, but it is me, why don't I understand? I am afraid, though, what am I afraid of? Me. I am afraid of me. I am not safe with me. I'm afraid of what's inside. Whoa. So here I am, with the light shining on my demons.

Experience:2 hits of LSD + weed - Mindfuck,"Currently writing this at a 3/10 in terms of highness. Being stoned helps me reflect upon some things when trying to recollect memories. Alright, well damn, this was sure a trip that changed me and my views upon life. Acid is such an interesting substance, it really does open doors to your mind that you never thought could be opened. It's pretty fun to know that, with the common doses of today, there is nothing similar to the doses that the old 60's and 70's people were doing. It was obviously much more potent back then, and some people have done massive doses, including thumbprint doses, which involves sticking your thumb into pure crystalline LSD and licking it. Someone told me that's around a couple hundred hits? Not sure, but that's insane. Anyways, enough rambling, onto the report. Keep in mind, the night before this I did 1 tab and smoked some, getting to bed around 3 AM, so I definitely had a bit of a tolerance when dosing the L, aswell as a semi-tired state of mind. T'was a good trip. But, I realized that trips shouldn't be done consecutively like that, and I indeed learned my lesson. I will respect the L much more from now on, and I am starting to meditate days before my trips. Alright, finally, the trip. So it all started out with me at my house, by myself, and I planned on having two other friends over later that day. They knew I was tripping and were going to just chill with me. I dropped both tabs at around 1, and the effects were kicking in after an hour. Got the usual 'wavy' feeling when looking everywhere, as well as the thought acceleration. I started peaking after about another 30 minutes, and shit was intense. A random thought, but the acid comeup can almost be described as the THX logo building up in intensity, but a much slower rate, and you can feel it throughout your whole body, as well as hear it. Anyways, I just chilled in my house, tripping off everything I could look at, feeling stimulated, listening to music and just having a great time. I realized I felt extremely happy and euphoric, and have never felt so happy in my life. Also, throughout the whole trip but mainly in the peak, I felt so connected to the universe, and I really felt like I was connected to a higher consciousness, as if I understood 'the big picture.' It was deja-vu like. Hard to explain. Then, I decided that I should go smoke some weed, to have even more fun. So I get outside, and smoke about 4 bowls of some decent bud. I had a tolerance at the time, but 4 bowls was enough to get me baked. 8/10 probably. Anyways, I smoke, get back inside, put my shit away and then go back to my normal tripping. This is when the mindfuck really kicks in. So I continue my tripping with music and stuff, and decide to turn off my music and sit down. I saw semi-detailed CEV's with eyes closed as well as some strange OEV's. As I looked into the blinds of my window, which were closed, I saw cubical OEV's, transparent in color, lining upon the blinds. They're kind of like floaters, but cubical, and they stood still. As I watched the trees outside, every single leaf and branch moved and flowed in perfect unison. Utterly amazing. I looked at myself in the mirror, watching my pupils dance in size. Anyways, as all this is happening, I realized I am starting to 'loop' sort of, repeating some actions which include: Walking down stairs, walking around the house, then walking upstairs. Going to refill my water only to realize it is still full. Other random things, nothing too crazy As I am looping, I can still feel the 'comeup' feeling of acid, impossible to describe but can only be understood when one has taken it. Anyways, I kind of realize, the loop was getting worse and worse, however there was absolutely nothing I could do to stop it. Thankfully, I was in a good setting at my house, so I had no worries of acting strange. I started to loop extremely badly, such as, checking my phone, then putting it down, then thinking, then checking my phone, then putting it down...etc and so on. The loop was like my mind racing a million miles a second, it's like thinking of thought A, then thinking of thought B, then thought C, then realizing I'm getting off track and try to track my thoughts back to thought A, when I could barely remember it. It's sooo hard to explain. The entire time, it felt very cyclic. It was a cycle, and I knew I was looping the entire time, but there was nothing I could do about it. This was accompanied with extreme deja vu and extreme confusion. I could not handle anything and could do nothing but sit there and just loop think. Every few seconds it would repeat, with a higher intensity to it. As I hit the peak of each loop, I get this strange feeling, and then it just restarts. (This is all while peaking still) Anyways, my friends come over and I'm still looping extremely hard. The looping I experienced was possible ego-loss. It's nearly impossible to describe this loop. But, if anyone reading this has had one, it's kind of like you cycle through loops, while hearing or experiencing the 'wahwahWAH' in the background. Hard to explain. We decide to go to Starbucks, and I believe that is what helped me sober out of the loop. I was still looping a little at Starbucks, but not as crazy as I was earlier. Still tripping, nothing too much, just intense visual distortions. After this, the trip really isn't much more crazy. I am coming down after that, so me and my friends get food (Which I didn't eat anything) then goto the beach to end the day. After this, I go home, and struggle to fall asleep for about an hour, and then finally sleep.

Experience:1 hit LSD (unknown dosage) - Choose Asia,"My father was a few years too old to be a hippy but not too old to be a bit of a head. We grew up as best friends and (for better or worse) it was he who introduced me to marijuana and alcohol. To this day we both share a fondness for pharmaceutical opiates that keeps us searching for the perfect buzz. We were a middle-class family - not wealthy by any means, but we had what we wanted. My father was addicted to travel, something that he passed on to me. When my senior year of High School was in full swing, my father gave me a choice: At graduation, you can have a new car, OR we can backpack across Asia for three months. New car or Asia? New car or Asia? Hmmm - which one would you choose? So before long we had our 'round the world' tickets in hand and the day came for us to leave. My uncle and some friends were at our house to say goodbye, and we departed - with a stop at Grandma's house on the way to the airport. As we were leaving Grandma's my uncle tore into the driveway with his car. He had forgotten to give us something. He reached into his pocket, pulled out his wallet and dug out two hits of blotter acid. 'I know that the right time and place for you to experience this will become apparent,' he told me. We hid the two hits in my father's camera. (I won't reveal whereas it is a hiding place that continues to serve me well.) Fast forward three months and after visiting some countries and seeing and doing the most amazing things and meeting wonderful people and making wonderful friends we found ourselves in Srinigar, the capital of Kashmir in Northern India. Because of border violence with Pakistan, I don't think it's easy to get to Srinagar anymore, but back then we reached it with relative ease. We stayed on a houseboat in Srinagar on beautiful Lake Dal. For some reason, the English never took complete control of Kashmir and it remained under the rule of a Maharaja who enforced a law stating that no English could own land in Kashmir. The English wanted to be there in the Himalayan foothills to escape the unbearable summer heat in the rest of India. To circumvent the 'no land ownership' law they built elaborate palace-like houseboats - thousands of them - all to sit on the lake. By the time we got there in the late 80s, the British were of course gone, and the houseboats were all privately owned and the focal point of a huge tourist business in this city - mostly for wealthy Hindus from the south trying to escape from the heat, but for adventurous Westerners as well. The boat we ended up on was the 'Omar Khayyam' (all the boats had names), and it was owned and run by a Muslim family. The father's name was 'Golem' which I got a kick out of being an LOTR fan. The boats were usually big enough to accommodate more than one party, and so we were soon joined on the Omar Khayyam by a charming Irish couple with whom we hit it off immediately. Golem scored some hash for us (he said he could get us a kilo of hash for USD$100 if we wanted...) and we spent several days in the fantastic Himalayan air relaxing, reading and getting to know one another. We (my father, myself and the Irish couple, 'J&M' from here on) decided that we wanted to go up into the Himalayan mountains east to the ancient Tibetan city of Leh in a semi-province of India called 'Ladakh.' Ladakh is the part of Tibet that falls on the Indian side of the border with China. It had also been the destination of tens of thousands of Tibetan refugees after the Chinese takeover of Tibet in 1959. Ladakh is not far from where the Dalai Lama himself makes his home in India. Getting there is a story unto itself, the brief version of which is that it took two full days in a Hindustani Ambassador (a popular Indian-made car) as part of a military caravan to get to Leh, the capital of Ladakh on the most dangerous road I have ever seen. With the height of these mountains and their roads and the poor condition of them, I would find it hard to believe that a more dangerous highway exists. Eventually, we finally reached Leh, and it was unbelievable. An ancient Tibetan town that was just beginning to be seriously touched by tourism. We found a hotel where all rooms opened onto a beautiful garden where an ancient ascetic in full Tibetan garb set chanting and spinning his prayer wheel for the entire time we were there - we never saw him eat or drink or get up - nothing. When you reach this sort of altitude in the Himalayas there is no water - it is like a desert (often described as a 'moonscape'), and subsequently there is very little vegetation - except where water has been irrigated in. So the town sat at the edge of a mountain overlooking a barren plain, and the town itself was an emerald of green because it received meager irrigation. My father and I decided that this would be the place for me to experience the LSD. My dad was concerned about heart palpitations he had so he decided not to trip however our Irish companion (J of J & M) decided to join me. My uncle had recommended taking a quarter tab, waiting 45 minutes, taking another, waiting another 45 minutes, etc. until something came on. I felt nothing and finally took the 4th and final quarter. It was around this time that we ran into J, told him what was going on and he joined in, simply taking the whole tab. J had never tripped either. With my father, I climbed above the town to a small, ancient cemetery full of crumbling, white-washed burial stupas. The town was below us, bustling with activity and the vast empty valley stretched out for miles ahead. There is a small Muslim community in Leh, and the call to prayer began, amplified by a loudspeaker somewhere. It was at that moment that the LSD hit me like a ton of bricks. I stood up, grinning, and told my father 'It's on!' What a place to be a young man experiencing LSD for the first time. We walked down the mountain back into town and through the streets - streets filled with camels, Tibetan monks, emaciated European backpackers, chai stalls, truck drivers, dirty-faced Tibetan kids and lovely Tibetan women who smiled unabashedly when you looked them in the eye. I was tripping hard, so we retreated to the peace of the hotel garden where the old man was spinning his prayer wheel. 'J' somehow found us and joined us and we sat there in bliss, trying to take it all in. This LSD experience was mechanically the most exciting for me ever. I was filled with happiness and love and respect, and I was acutely aware of where I was geographically and historically and what the things around me meant. I also experienced things like hearing the hinge on a gate squeak from 100 yards away. I can remember lighting a cigarette and following a train of thought and vision that seemed to last hours, only to look down at the cigarette and find hardly the tiniest bit of ash had accumulated at the end of it. I had heard from my father that when he had done LSD one time he looked in the mirror and saw his flesh fall away from his face. With this image fully implanted in my young mind I went into the bathroom and saw the same thing - my face melted away leaving my grinning skull. I lifted my shirt, and the flesh rotted away leaving my ribcage exposed. I found this incredibly funny and amusing and was having trouble keeping from laughing uncontrollably. J and I sat for hours in the yard talking and infecting one another with giggle-fits. We ran out of cigarettes, and I have delegated the task of buying a new pack somewhere, so I left the garden on foot to walk around the marketplace in full-trip. I grinned and smiled at everyone, and they grinned and smiled back. I found someplace to buy the smokes and had lots of difficulties figuring out how the money worked, how to pay, etc., but eventually I persevered. J's partner M was pissed at us because we forced her to stick around town that day instead of exploring temples within driving distance in the surrounding area. I didn't let it bother me, nor did J, however as the afternoon wore on and the effects gradually faded we were grateful as we felt the need to reconnect with M and do something special for her. By the time we were more-or-less back to normal we were on our way to a 'fancy' (everything is relative) restaurant with Tibetan fare that M had expressed an interest in. To this day I have yet to have any chemical experience that even approached this one regarding emotions, connection to the surrounding landscape and people, a sense of history, a sense of camaraderie. It was even very special in that my father officially passed the torch of psychedelia to me on that day. J & M are no longer a couple, but we still keep in touch with J and see him periodically. Several years later J became sort of a hero in his country because he rescued a near-dead fisherman who had been adrift in 'the horse latitudes' for weeks. I often wonder if the experience in Ladakh changed my life and if so, what did it change. The memory of that day is burned into my mind with such clarity - unusual clarity as I do not consider myself as someone with a great memory or great ability to recall events. So kids - when it's graduation time, and your Dad gives you a choice of a car or a trip to Asia, choose Asia.

Experience:Hawaiian Baby Woodrose (5 seeds) - Five seeds from hell,"I don't have much to say about Hawaiian Baby Wood Rose seeds other than that they took me through hell. I ground up five seeds in a pestle in a mortar, stirred the powder in water, allowed the mixture to sit overnight, and then filtered the following day through a coffee filter. T+0 - I sipped on the LSA brew, chasing each drink with a sip of ginger tea. I'd heard a lot of bad things about the LSA nausea, so I made sure not to eat anything a few hours before. The ginger tea was included to also reduce nausea. The taste wasn't too terrible. It kind of tastes like a watered down brew of compost. It was not pleasant. T+30 - I took a walk around my neighborhood and started noticing some stomach discomfort around the thirty-minute mark. No real effects other than placebo. T+45 - 1:30 - Got home, and threw on some music. Music didn't sound much better. I had a pretty heavy body load and just wanted to lay down. I laid on my couch for a solid 45 minutes. I didn't have any pleasant effects. Mostly just wondering why nothing was happening T+1:45 - Mom called me to dinner. I sat down to eat and was on the verge of tears throughout the whole meal. I couldn't eat much. I then did the dishes and didn't feel much better. T+2:00 - I feel fucked. Everything is shitty. I'm worried about my girlfriend for no reason at all, and I hate everything. I just want to cry. I was burning some incense in my room at the time (Aloe Vera scented. This will be relevant later). I decide that staying around the house is only making things worse, so I take a bike ride. T+2:15 - Still no pleasant effects. Biking is easy. I biked all around my side of town, and while riding, I came to the conclusion that drug use was making me depressed. This made me happier, so I biked faster. I called up a friend of mine and said I was done doing all drugs (I'm a pretty regular weed smoker). She was happy for me, and said she would help if I ""slid back into use."" T+3:30 - Got home from my bike ride. Still getting really bad vibes from the house, so I decide to go out for a jog. Still no fun effects. I'm just chasing the high that comes after exercise. I ran to a nearby track and just jogged around for an hour. T+4:30 - I finally come back home, thinking that everything is better. Once I enter my room, I smell the Aloe incense. This immediately brings back the horrible emotions that I was feeling a couple of hours ago, so I spray cologne all over my room, burn a different incense, and throw away the aloe incense. This feels mildly liberating, and though I still am having negative emotions, I am doing better. T+5:00 - I throw in the movie ""Remember The Titans"" to keep my mind off of things. I've pretty much forgotten that I was even tripping. No real good effects are noticeable. T+ 6:30 - Deciding that I was no longer tripping, I call my girlfriend up. I tell her that I am done with all drugs and that I drank tea (the LSA brew) that showed me drugs were hurting our relationship. She is very happy, and so am I. T+ 8:00 - I'm pretty exhausted, so I lay down in bed. The seeds have completely worn off now, and the only reason I realize that is because I begin regretting my decision to stop doing drugs. 4 days later, I bought some weed, and smoked.

Experience:800 seeds LSA - My First Trip Ever,"Context: I had gotten interested in psychedelics so I ordered some morning glory seeds. Never having done anything like this before, I did not know what to expect. Dinner time: I ate spaghetti for dinner and I decided to take the seeds. It was roughly 5:30, and it seemed like a good time. The packet had 1500 seeds in it, so I poured roughly half of the seeds out in my hand. I smelled them and it was a very natural, earthy smell. I decided to take the seeds in two mouthfuls, since all of the seeds at once would be too much. I put half the seeds in my mouth and began chewing. The taste wasn't that bad. It became difficult to swallow, so I quickly got a cup of lemonade and got the seeds down pretty quickly. I put the second amount of seeds in my mouth. It was harder to get them down this time, even with lemonade. I gaged but I got them down. 30 minutes in: I felt very weak and laid down on the couch. I had read online that morning glory seeds cause nausea, and I was determined not to throw up. The nausea wasn't too bad at this point. Mostly just a feeling of overwhelming weakness was present. I was listening to music but I put down my computer and just laid there for the come up. 1 hour in: After laying on the couch for a while, the nausea went away. I began to notice a very pleasant sensation throughout my body. It was a mellow stoning feeling, very nice indeed. I got excited and walked to my room and put my bed covers over my face so I could see if there were any CEVs. The first thing I saw was a dimly lit grid of lines with small shapes moving between the squares in the grid. I just laid in my bed for about twenty minutes and watched that grid. 1 hour and 30 minutes in: I was feeling very euphoric at this point and I remember my mom saying that she was going to the store. She didn't know I had taken anything. I said okay and I went on the back porch and laid on the couch. I specifically remember how beautiful the trees looked, swaying in the wind. After a bit of laying there, I went outside and laid in the grass. It felt like the grass was slowly eating me and I didn't mind. I looked up at the trees above me, laughing like crazy and thinking a lot of thoughts about the universe. I have no idea how long I was laying out there, but eventually I went back inside the porch. I began to notice some tracers when I moved my iPod too quickly. Later...: At this point I begin to lose track of time. My mom came home and she called my name but I couldn't get up off the couch on the porch. The euphoria was too strong for me to even think about moving. But then I thought she might get really scared if she didn't see me anywhere in the house, so I got up. Gravity seemed to be heavier as I made my way inside. Vasoconstriction was relatively moderate in my extremities. I don't remember what she got at the store, but she didn't seem to notice I was on anything. I went back to my room and closed my eyes. I saw a lot of different settings and landscapes. I don't remember that much from the landscapes except ancient Egyptians and pyramids, along with some cryptic bursts of thought. Around 4 hours in: It's dark outside at this point and I'm sitting in the TV room on the couch. I can't remember if the TV was on or not, but either way it doesn't matter because staring at the floor was a lot more entertaining. It was drifting(flowing) like an ocean. I just couldn't stop staring at it. I got up and looked in the mirror. My eyes were more dilated than i've ever seen them, and everything looked extremely crisp and detailed. I sat back down on the couch and texted my friends. I tried explaining to them that I was tripping, but I ended up just typing random things about the universe. They were very confused. I noticed that the tracers were increasing in their intensity, as moving the texts up or down would make solid tracers. About 4 hours 30 minutes in: I began to enter ego death. The rapid thoughts that I had been having up to this point began to slow down until I wasn't thinking about anything. I was just there, existing. I don't remember anything from the ego death. I have no idea how long I was gone but when I came back I didn't even realize what had happened. When I came back I was still holding my can of coca cola. I put the can of coke on the table next to the couch. I just continued sitting there for a while, I don't know how long. Eventually my mom walked by and got concerned, because I looked like a rag doll. She asked if I was okay and I said yes. I knew that she looked familiar, and that my house looked familiar, but that's about all I knew. I put my hand on my chest and I couldn't feel a heartbeat. I also couldn't tell if I was breathing or not. Normally this would have concerned me, but it didn't this time. I felt like I knew the purpose behind why I wasn't able to breath, and that was good enough for me. I felt like I knew the answers to every question in the world, without even thinking about it. I just had the answers, as they presented themselves from an unknown place in my head. Maybe 5 hours and 30 minutes in: I got the wonderful idea of listening to music on my computer. I hadn't listened to music up to this point, except for the come up. It took a moment to remember the password to my computer but I eventually got it. I picked out and a song with a lot of bass and put the equalizer to max bass. Then I put my earbuds in and started the song. This was one of the most intense things i've ever experienced. It felt like the song was ripping my consciousness out of my body. The visuals really started picking up. The carpet was flowing more than ever, and then I looked at the front door. It was morphing like it was dancing to the song. I glanced at my hand and my skin was flowing. The shadows on my hand were melting down my wrist. After a little bit of staring at my hand, I realized that my hand was many different geometric shapes. It was mostly three dimensional triangles and trapezoids, seamlessly interconnecting with each other as they moved. My mom went to the front door to go out to smoke a cigarette, and the door was flowing as she opened it and closed it. After listening to music: I started feeling really sick to my stomach so I went to the other room and laid on that couch. I laid there for a good while, I might have even fallen asleep there but I can't remember. If I did fall asleep, it was definitely a light sleep. I eventually decided to go to bed. I got in bed and laid in the dark while watching the geometry. I tried going to sleep for a while but it didn't work. Eventually I fell asleep. 2 AM: I woke up from sleep extremely quickly and shot straight up out of bed and immediately puked on the floor. I could have found something to puke on, but it didn't even cross my mind because I had just woken up. So now there's a pile of thrown up spaghetti and seeds on my floor. I tried my best to clean it up, but it was hard to get my hands to work. The body load was pretty heavy still and I couldn't really focus on a task. The puke began drifting and I laughed a little bit. I gave up trying to clean it and put a towel over it to hide it. I still felt sick and laid on the floor. I thew up again, this time on the towel. I decided that I would never take morning glory seeds again. I got back in bed and went to sleep once more. 9 AM: I woke up pretty early and felt amazingly rejuvenated. Everything looked and felt so crisp and vibrant. I didn't really feel like sick anymore. I explained to my friends that I was tripping last night and straightened that out. The rejuvenation lasted about a month.

Experience: 80mg EPT - Slight improvement,"I weigh out 80 mg of EPT, and it's none of your business. I do the deed.

Some OEV, the drapes seem to be exhibiting 3-Dimensional textures, which freaks me out because I didn't expect any of this. I close my eyes, and it's the most aggressive confetti you can imagine. Endless colors, extremely bright, I would swear I felt the static touching me. 20 min - Sustained feelings, but I look at the timer and I was sure it had been an hour since I last checked it. Not remotely. 30-45 - It mostly trailed off around 40 min after I started, but there's still plenty of pattern recognition and symmetrical texture repetition. 1 hour - I feel very hungry, like I hadn't eaten in a day. Faint visuals remain for a while. 3 hours Definitely over with, a bit wired. Overall a much more positive experience than the last time. I honestly used the last I had this time, so it'll hard to pare it down to an appropriate dose.

"Experience: Oral & Insufflated DPT, Running up the Doses","This is a report of my first few experiences with Dipropyltryptamine, running up the doses by its most common routes of administration, orally and by insufflation (snorting). I used Alexander Shulgin's recommendations for assaying new materials, as it is consistent and recognizable. I have also used the Shulgin Rating Scale.[1] Time between between dosing ranged from 4 days to 2 weeks, over the course of about 6 weeks. For a general allergy and taste taste, 5mg was placed on and under tongue. Tastes very bitter and irritating, almost unbearably so. No effects. - (with 50mg, orally) No effects - (with 100mg, orally) A suggestion of some activity at about 30 minutes, that did not develop further. While not inactive, there seems nothing of value at this level. Baseline at less than 90 minutes. + (with 200mg, orally) A clear alert at 10 minutes, and I became aware of an inaudible but deeply felt hum. The “sound” was grounding and familiar. At 20 minutes the closed eye visuals were geometric and inorganic. Sharp night-vision green kaleidoscopic fractal patterning, like a hologram. At 1 hour, the deep humming became more defined, a vibrato pulsing that encouraged me to lie down. Shadows suggesting human shapes flickered on the wall in impossible colors, projected by an absent fire. The wall beside me became sand-like in color and texture. My attention was suddenly captured by a hallucination of what I can best describe as an ancient Egyptian relief — a person wearing a headdress — a wolf or dog. Symbols were revealed, an Ankh clearly visible, among others. Some appeared to be hieroglyphics, others unlike any I’d seen. I looked to the eyes of the person-in-the-wall, felt the words “not yet” communicated to me, before the hallucination wore away. At 90 minutes there was a sharp drop, and there were only light/residual effects until baseline was reached at approximately 3 hours. I cannot call this a “pleasant” experience, but oh my was it interesting. I would choose to explore the oral route at a higher dose, but I do not have enough of the material to do so. +++ (with 20mg, insufflated) Painful after a few seconds of contact with mucous membranes. Moderate burning sensation in back of throat and sinus as it drips. Feel first alert after about two minutes. A subtle shifting of consciousness developed over 20 minutes, an indescribable “on” that accompanies most psychedelics. There is a thickness to the air, but otherwise no visual activity. Baseline at one hour. + (with 40mg, insufflated) first alert in less 1 minute. At five minutes, mild visual distortions, things seem to be moving. For about 45 minutes I lay in bed listening to Aphex Twin as rapid geometry patterned behind my eyelids with euphoric synergism to the music. At about 1 hour the effects declined rapidly, reaching baseline by 90 minutes.This is a pleasant level, but not very interesting. ++ (with 80mg, insufflated) Felt the first alert only seconds after insufflation. Some of the material got caught in my sinus, which was painful and nauseating. I hurried to the bathroom in time to vomit before I started tripping. Flickering blues and greens sparkled in my vision, holographic triangles dripping out of form. At about 10 minutes, I had closed my eyes for just a moment, and upon opening them the entire room appeared to have rotated 180°, every surface became purple and white pinstripes, flowing like white water rapids. I was disoriented and scared, this was an utterly alien sensation. There was an undeniable presence in the room, and it did not feel friendly. I realized I was able to perceive the room unaltered simultaneously, and doing so brought me out of the hallucination. At 40 minutes the intensity faded quickly, but some visual distortions lingered until about the two hour mark. Baseline at 2 hours 15 minutes. +++ (with 120mg, insufflated) 120mg of DPT is a lot of powder, and it was an effort in itself just to ingest it by this route of administration, especially because it is so irritating to mucous membranes. Onset in less than a minute. A deep pulsing hum washed over me as I coughed from the irritation of the chemical dripping down my throat. The visuals were choppy and sharp, chaotic, glitching green transparent shapes that obstructed my vision. At 5 minutes the hum grew into a deafening buzzing that filled me with a profound sense of euphoria. At 10 minutes I felt pushed into the ground by it, the hum overtook me and absorbed me into its warmth. The hum became my entire perception. I could not separate my body from the sound, but I did remain aware of having one. When I was able to locate myself in corporeality, a check of the clock revealed only 40 minutes had passed since dosing. By the 1 hour the effects were only residual, very minor visuals fading off to baseline at two hours. This level seemed to produce a lot of darting, particularly in the legs. I will not run up the dose on this ROA further. +++","['auditory hallucinations', 'autonomous entities', 'autonomous voice communication', 'changes in felt bodily form', 'changes in gravity', 'cognitive euphoria', 'colour shifting', 'drifting', 'geometry', 'internal hallucinations', 'nausea', 'perspective distortions', 'synaesthesia', 'transformations', 'visual haze']",1134
Experience:150mg DPT - A Walk Into The Depths of Insanity,"After having tripped on DPT at least 10 times, I thought that I had mastered the chemical. I was completely wrong. On 12/3/2017 at about 12:00PM I decided that I would insufflate 150 milligrams of DPT and go on a walk up the road to the dollar store. Shortly after leaving home, I vomited profusely (due to the unsettling taste of the chemical's drip). Within 5 minutes, I was experiencing intense level 6 geometry. I began to freak out, thinking that there was no way I could go inside the dollar store like this. I continued walking, but it did not feel like I was moving at all. It felt as if I was walking in place while the world was zooming past me. As things became increasingly more intense, my trip took on a sinister and very unpleasant vibe. The visuals were so intense that I no longer knew where I was. The bodily sensations and visual impairment were just completely overwhelming. I had an extremely disconcerting sense of dysphoria. I felt as if I were in a cartoon-like nightmare. Even though I am very experienced with this chemical, I had formed a delusion that my mind was completely broken and I had gone insane. I thought the trip would never end - it felt like I had been tripping for hours even though it was barely 15 minutes. At this point, I began to really start spazzing out. I would run back and forth up and down the road forgetting where I was and where I was going. I was completely lost, and I kept telling myself how much of an idiot I was for thinking I could handle this. I completely accepted that my mind was broken, that I would never be the same again. At this point, I started to form very unsettling scenarios and plots. I thought that I had been running around town tweaking for hours, and that everyone was in their yard pointing at me and laughing. I could literally hear voices yelling ""Look at him! He's gone crazy!"" I felt as if I had made some big mistake, and everyone knew what was going on. In reality, I don't think anyone was around. I ended up sitting on a bridge, overlooking a river. I thought that life as I knew it was over. I thought about how my family would react, knowing that I had gone insane. They had warned me several times to stop taking psychedelic drugs, or I would one day end up in a mental hospital. I did not want to be suffering like this for all eternity in a mental hospital, so I came to the conclusion that I must die. At first, I was upset about this. I was literally in tears. I thought about everything that would happen once I died. I felt sorry for all of the people who would be affected, and the people who would get in trouble for supplying me with this ""impure"" DPT that had so severely and indefinitely ruined my mind. I thought about my family and how much they would missed me, I even imagined my funeral. But I did not care - I was intent to end this pain and suffering. I thought about all of the ways I could die. Perhaps drown myself in the river? Jump in front of someone's car? But then I realized that I was may not be spiritually prepared for death. What if the trip continued into the afterlife? Would I be suffering like this for ever and ever? I decided that I had to say goodbye to my mother. I ran home and told her that I had taken a drug called dipropyltryptamine, and that I had gone insane forever. She had no clue what I was talking about, and was very concerned because I had lost one of my sandals, I had a busted bloody lip, and I was covered in vomit and mud. I begged my mom to kill me and put me out of my misery, before I got into the system and would have to suffer forever. She called 911 and told the paramedics that I was suffering from a drug overdose. They rushed me into the emergency room as if I was dying, which did not make my trip go any better. They said that my heart rate was 4 times what it should be, and my blood pressure was sky high. Thankfully, my trip came to an end shortly after arriving at the hospital. The doctors had no clue what to do since they had never heard of DPT. They contacted the poison control center, and then made me stay on IV fluids for over 5 hours. I also had to do a psychological evaluation before being able to leave. This was an extremely humbling experience, and I have learned that I must show proper respect for a chemical this powerful. I had no business going in public on such a high dose, let alone by myself. I am very lucky that I did not commit suicide, even when I had accepted that it was the only option. I have tripped hundreds of times over the past few years, and never experienced anything this profound.","['anxiety', 'auditory hallucinations', 'geometry', 'paranoia', 'time distortion']",1032
Experience:75 mg - Good tunes feat. Jeb Bush,"I weigh out 75 mg, chop into 2 grey/off white lines. Start - Up the hose, in my nose, immediate sting, which lingers for some time. The taste is plastic, alien, and the drip lasts for maybe 10 minutes. 5 min - Next. Yep, feels just as bad as the first one, the expectation did not help. Mild headache, moderate dry-heaving. 15 min - I'm definitely starting to feel a tingle, so I put on the new Clap! Clap! album, which I can quickly immerse myself in. 20 min - It's dark in my room, so I can't distinguish between OEV and CEV. I see purple and blue humor/tragedy masks. These fade into red, blue and yellow 4 sided tesselations, many of which contain celtic knots. I am overcome with severe nausea. 30-45 - Nausea completely dissipated. Several visions of glowing women, staring at me, possible entities, but none try to communicate verbally. They make a welcoming gesture towards me, and there is a molten tsunami of euphoria. I stare directly through the top of my head, and I can now see that my cranium actually contains the entire cosmos. It's like that Robert Anton Wilson interview where he says he has one head inside the universe and the other is outside. For some awful reason, Jeb Bush and his stupid smile show up and everyone scatters. I'm angry and then see Leatherface, from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which obviously terrifies me. I make my escape. 1 hour - I get the bright idea to turn the fucking light on, and Jesus, my whole room is sage/beige, and it seems like one single item. There are no seams, no cracks, just ""Room."" My field of vision is taken over by translucent Bismuth, diffracting the light, which then spirals outward. 1 hour, 15 min I've earned a smoke by now, so I go out the front door. The street lights are beautiful, and I light the cigarette. Easily one the most rewarding smokes I've ever experienced, and these aren't even my brand. The very tip of the ash looks like an ugly flower with 1,000 petals, and the rest of the burning bit looks like the Tower of Babel. I will never forget this smoke. 1 hour, 30 min I definitely couldn't drive, but I couldn't honestly say I'm ""tripping"" anymore. I get out my laptop and try to put my illegible notes and scattered memories together into a coherent report. 3 hours I remember to stop the timer on my phone. I have no idea what I just did for 90 min. Guess I was still a bit off. I feel very hungry. Overall, a very positive and humorous experience. I wish I had taken more, but it totally served it's purpose.","['cognitive euphoria', 'diffraction', 'drifting', 'existential self realization', 'geometry', 'increased libido', 'increased music appreciation', 'internal hallucination', 'nausea', 'physical euphoria', 'respiratory depression', 'symmetrical texture repetition', 'time distortion', 'unity and interconnectedness']",607
"Experience: 10mg & 20mg Intravenous DPT HCl - Familiar Shapes, Experiencing Death, Immersed in The Light","(with 10mg, i.v.) There was dissolved 10mg DPT in .2mL sterile saline solution, injected into the cephalic vein (at crook of arm). Onset was instantaneous — a massive rush of euphoria, the air became thick and dripped with ever-shifting geometry. I was immobilized but pleasantly so. I felt a push to close my eyes, simply enjoying the beautiful, impossibly familiar shapes transform behind my eyelids. Sharp drop in activity at about 8 minutes, and I was able to speak with my trip-sitter. Baseline at 20 minutes. This was a wonderful, serene experience. (with 20mg, i.v.) There was dissolved 20mg DPT in .5mL sterile saline solution, injected as previously described. At 1 second, my whole visual field was disintegrating, as that familiar buzz-hum roared through my entire being. At 2 seconds, I felt a pressure around me — like I was in a centrifuge. At 3 seconds, this pressure became an unstoppable force, and I couldn’t tell if my eyes were open or closed. Kaleidoscopic motion rapidly decayed, swirling apart like galaxies bursting and losing all form, a chaos like every individual star moving in a different direction. I realized I was dying, but I was not afraid. Some part of me knew it was not a literal death of the body, so I thought “I accept this death”, and I died. Infinite luminous light. Nothing. All. I could not describe this eternal moment. Ineffable, everything. I opened my eyes, the visual noise gathering itself back into cosmic order. Once I was able to identify that I was back, the supreme intensity of the experience dropped as abruptly as it had begun. It felt like it had all happened in a second, but was in fact 15 minutes. I was speechless for several hours, completely rapt in awe and reverence.

Experience:Unknown Dose DOC (Insufflated) - Overdosing and Terifying Ego Death,"I'm fairly experienced with psychedelics, especially Phenethtylamines, less so with Tryptamines. I've had very heavy dosages of some, including LSD, DXM, 2C-P and DOM, of which I've never had any serious problems that I couldn't handle, but this experience was the single most intense and frightening drug experience I've ever and nothing I've ever had even slightly compares to this. I've been thrown into a state of madness and fear and for the first time thought I was legitimately dying. I unknowingly overdosed, alone, which is very bad on it's own, but I can imagine it being way more traumatizing and dangerous if I was around people (especially friends, especially the wrong ones) at the time (this would probably have scarred friendship if anyone I knew saw me and I am very happy today that this was not the case). I have a ton of experience with DOC, using it every weekend about a year ago, since it's insanely cheap, potent and strong. My highest dose was 8 milligrams oral and my last dose of DOC nearly a year ago was 3 milligrams snorted. Both of these experiences (actually all to an extent) were intensely paranoia-inducing and I was always very scared and uncomfortable around people or alone (I had hidden social anxiety at the time), yet I still chose to do it every weekend, for what reason except being high I don't know. My reason for this was simply exploring the power of psychedelic amphetamines, what actually lies above the standard doses. I always do my research although I focus more on the good things than the bad ones, which it took some time and a good friend in a similar situation to realize. I guess that's just how addiction slowly reprograms your brain. I will never go back to that place again. T+0:00 Being the slightly junkie-like person I was back then, I settled somewhere in the woods (which was unusually crowded and windy) and as fast as possible I put my line on my phone, ""to be safe"" about three quarters of a capsule weighed as 10 milligrams (which was displayed on my scale, but only now I know that such small dosages on scales are practically unreliable, so I have no idea how much was actually in there). Probably one half of a milligram of what was on my phone was also blown away from the wind. I suspect the dose to be anywhere between 8 to 12 milligrams (with analyzing what it looked like eyeballed and what was left in the capsule). Note that I originally planned to take the whole thing... I snorted. There was no initial burn. Upon looking behind me, there was some guy walking his dog coming towards me, so I quickly got up and went. Pretty sure he saw me but not what I was doing. I put on my beats, decided to play some trap music (say Trapcity etc). T+0:05 It took about five minutes before I felt anything. Now it started to burn slightly in my nose and in what felt like an instant the visuals just popped up, comparable to what you would see on 200 mics. Already there were strange body sensations and I was unable to talk with the guy from before, which said something to me about his dog being shy and stuff. Luckily he didn't question me anything. T+0:10 By now I was on top of the hill, had a nice view and then I knew I was tripping pretty hard, but was not dysphoric yet (in fact I don't know what exactly I felt then). Everything looked extremely surreal, colors were way brighter, almost blinding and simplified. There were also some patterns which displayed themselves on the field, transparent lines which swirled into each other. I only have that one image of what the field looked like, but not anything else I looked at, which makes me believe these were the first hints of amnesia or memory encoding failures. The one word I thought of then to describe these visuals was ""cheap"". Similar to the motive on Hoffman blotters. T+0:15 I was still walking, I still don't know what I was feeling then, it was kinda an empty, hollow soul within me, no emotions felt, no questions asked. I couldn't feel my whole body and my lips and mouth were getting uncomfortably numb. What I could feel was the burn in the back of my nose which felt very caustic as if my skin starts to crack up and dry out, I had the feeling I was about to get a nose bleed but I didn't which further confused me. I start fidgeting with a piece of paper in my one pocket and the volume buttons of my phone in the other without realizing it. The weather was weird, there were occasional strong winds of coldness and mist, which I couldn't feel but still aggravated me. I got slightly fearful by now, which was probably mostly due to the music, which since I pressed the volume buttons sounded very faint and distant and everything that I did hear were screeches and hollow melodies and bass from the trap (not really happy music). T+0:20 I had to sit down for a moment. I wasn't myself anymore, looking around I realized that something is wrong, my brain is massively overloaded, and so was my body and vision. I had some Etizolam with me, and Flunitrazolam, of which I took 0.5 and 0.125 milligrams, respectively, which isn't that much. I got up and started walking straight into the woods, where several new effects such as fear, panic and amnesia took me. My actions were now controlled by these. As I started walking i instantly tried to take a final full Etizolam pill of 2mg, but the pill was in a tiny plastic baggie, which zipper was impossible to open. I tried to rip it off but that didn't help much. I didn't know the position of my fingers in space. I kept trying to open it, not realizing I could just chew it or whatever. Eventually it fell down, I tried searching for it but was unable to. The baggie was orange, the floor was white. As time went on while I was walking I didn't know who or where I was, just that I am in big trouble and am probably dying. The music was now disturbingly quiet so I ripped off my headphones, but this didn't help. Somehow the fact that I was still walking or at least standing kept me convinced I was still alive. T+0:30 I had my first blackout I believe. I'm pretty sure I was conscious during it but thinking back as to why I was inside the woods I immediately knew there was this short gap in my memory. I didn't know what to do, honestly no idea what you should even do in such a situation. I was basically just standing around mid-road observing the insane visuals, giant comical eyes swirling around me in medium-fast speed, tons of brown birds in the trees which also looked straight out of a comic book. I wasn't blinded but couldn't really see anything either. Suddenly the thought that I might die if I don't get help now strikes me and my goal now was to find someone to call an ambulance. I walked quickly to get out of the forest, while the effects still get stronger and stronger. T+0:40? My entire field of view is filled with big-sized green and white rectangles, which embedded comical eyes swirling around my center of view accompanied by insane distortion. Strictly 2D but extremely huge in size. They were unavoidable and different from typical geometry, as I didn't know what was actually geometry and what was the insane drifting of the outside world. Delusions overtake me, I somehow had the belief that what I took wasn't DOC, but some failed research chemical which is now going to kill me because this shitty vendor wanted me to. This is probably one of the most horrifying deaths I could imagine. There is no pain, but an overloaded brain which cannot handle anything it perceives, eventually seizing until the load is so big it fries. It's like losing your mind. I had no idea who I was, just that I'm about to die. I started running in a very desperate attempt to find someone. It was very hard to actually recognize anything, and I actually ran past a few people at a fireplace, only to look back about 400 feet further and then running towards them as fast as I could. My first line was something I don't remember, followed by ""-i need an ambulance"". There was some discussion I don't fully remember, but I told them that I'm seriously not feeling good at all. Talking with them was very weird. I was like a child again, only using simple words and being very shy. Somehow I got the feeling they couldn't understand the current situation, I was clearly overdosing and they still kept questioning what exactly the problem is. They called the ambulance and told me to sit down, which I did, putting my face in my hands stooping into my legs. I was feeling less panicked since I knew help was on the way but still I was heavily delusional. T+?? I blacked out until the ambulance came. The hospital is on the other side of town, it literally must've taken them at least 15 minutes to arrive, but my sense of time then was practically nonexistent, it just seemed so quick, almost instantly. There is one memory of that period of this which is very hard to describe, it's that whatever my current state is is only temporary, and that I will return back to control and then know who I am again. This thought was mixed with a vision of the states, first a line, then a scrambled-appearing green tint and then again a line (symbolizing the initial effects, the part where I was gone and the part where I return to myself). This is very hard to put in words, nor even I can't completely make sense of it. Synaesthesia? I can't say!!! I've had an acid trip before which also had the initial high, then it turned into a bad trip and then I was feeling good again (roughly), this was what I thought of. As the ambulance arrived I woke up, looked around me, I thought that now I was back to normal, but this just another delusion. Everyone was still here, their faces very distorted, but one of them I still think I know how he looks like. I again asked in a very slurred manner that I need an ambulance. The guy told me it was here, that this is what I wanted, right? I don't think he was worried in any way and I got the impression he was slightly pissed. I looked back and saw the ambulance driving down the road. Stuff from here on is very blurred in my memory. There are only bits and pieces, and every one does not make any sense nor can I place these in a timeline. I don't remember seeing any of the staff from the ambulance, getting into it, getting out of it, nor anything that happened in the hospital. Side note: From the reports I've got, somewhere between be getting picked up and me falling asleep in the hospital I was needed to be injected with a total of 3 milligrams of Midazolam IV over three separate doses. My heart rate peaked at 160 BPMs, my blood pressure was negligibly raised, which actually surprised me. By now I had no idea who is was, nor did I know what reality was. My existence was within hallucinations only. There was nothing I knew about myself, I just existed in this horrifying place outside the main world. Everything is dark and these scenarios just played with me being the lead entity living in this place. Interestingly I did know for example who the voices were that I heard, as well as if something was a human entity or not, or who it was. Maybe this is what you could call an ego death, at least partial. My memories are as followed, they are very hard to put into words and are possibly just insanity combined with delusions on a psychedelic experience. My first memory is getting into the ambulance and laying down, there's blood over my arms and I was feeling like shit, when later my body imploded and huge amounts of blood spilled everywhere, everyone was in shock, as if I knew what they were feeling even though I didn't see anyone. Not sure if what I saw was actually my body and the inside of the ambulance or if everything as a whole was a hallucination. My one friend, who I randomly saw before the trip, plus another one from my school I go were now with me in the ambulance, the first said ""hey yo dude"" and the latter ""wow, cool"" and were somewhat enthusiastic about my experience. Me on the other side was very embarrassed that they have to see me like this. Is this what was expected? The kid who does drugs finally overdoses and this is how far he has sunk? Of course that's always how it turns out! And I am that kid!! The ambulance somehow contacted them or something because they needed information from them? They were not actually present. Now there was mainly just blackness, I was not in the ambulance anymore and have slipped out of reality. I was in a bus and saw my ex girlfriend along with my best friends girlfriend, first my best bro's GF looks at me in a very seducing way (like it's the thing we all as friends do because we like each other), with lots of beautiful eyeliner and a very cartoony appearance, followed by my own ex GF which tried to look at me but I accidentally looked away, when then I looked back and she looked back too. An awkward moment. I could feel her awkwardness alongside mine. Everything looked so unrealistic and dream like, which I cannot put to words. The movements were extremely fluid and very fixed, like how a computer renders animations, how one looks like when played forwards then backwards. The colors were very simple and everything had a rounded edge to it. Fast forward and I was hearing my ex boss from years ago, whom I pretty much never think of, and my mom crying in the distance while I saw the ambulance I was in driving away from the place I was, but at nighttime. Neither of them were present as well. The crying of my mom really scared me, it sounded like as if she just saw me dying. I also have no idea how I thought of my boss from that place I worked years ago. Why was this hidden memory revealed? I don't remember what exactly the next scenes were as everything became darker. I heard several different voices of jumbled and unrecognizable words and sentences, ""human sounds"" of extremely varying speeds, seemingly slowing down then talking three times faster mid-word. I didn't understand a single word. Some I didn't get out of my head since them (not the voices, but the memory of them). I can't describe what they sounded like, nor can I reproduce them, it's only the memory that remains. There were some emotions tied to them when I heard them. Back into the ambulance, my body has dissolved into my mind and somehow I got the sense that both where the same thing and that we are all the same. I don't remember much that happened then, but every few seconds two separate things (no idea what tho) merged into one and both me and the nurses in the ambulance (if there were any) again realized that everything is indeed everything, while we also questioned ""why can you even explain anything?"". I was somehow myself and these nurses simultaneously, again, I didn't see any but felt their presence. T+16:00 I suddenly wake up in intensive care, completely refreshed, no trauma, no anxiety, no bad feelings at all. For the first moments I had no idea how I've got there, but I was sedated and didn't panic at all. Visuals were still pretty strong, although now very beautiful and different from before (similar to moderate dosages). I was seeing a lot of women with my eyes closes (CEVs) as well as shapes and green glows with my eyes open. The people there were really nice to me and asked me where I was, what I did etc, but something told me that inside they were very annoyed and not really happy by crashing into the hospital and staying a night. One guy asked really obvious insulting questions, such as ""so, when's the next time?"" or ""so, when are going home?"" while having this convincing grin on his face. I simply answered: ""I need to work tomorrow, I'll stay here a bit until I'm fully awake"". I spent some time there enjoying every second from 5 AM to 7 AM, just looking at the visuals, not using my phone and whatnot, just enjoying existence as it is. Very refreshing. My belongings were all in one giant plastic bag, notable objects include the piece of paper, which was heavily crumbled while still open, and the remaining capsule, which I am 100% sure was in my jacket pocket, but found it in my backpack. How am I supposed to interpret this? How would I have reacted? Throw it away and feed the kid's drug use or give it to him and feed his drug use? T+21:00 Visuals still here, I get out of the hospital really fatigued like never before. I drive some bus and then a friend of me simply texted me and I went out with him. The visuals continued to probably the 24 hour mark when they disappeared. It was very exhausting to do anything, especially hanging out in bright weather. My nose was still burning a lot, especially when moving my nose up. The skin felt very cracked and not healthy at all. This continued for a day or so. Then the next three days or so I was completely worn out, especially at work I had difficulties performing tasks. The next weekend I took the remaining DOC carefully, mixed carefully with LSD and had a wonderful time, at the same place on the same substance. After this I luckily suffered no such things as trauma, flashbacks, HPPD or other cognitive or physical deficits. I am really glad that I didn't do any permanent damage, and I really noticed how easy it is to just let yourself get caught in these ideas while not paying attention to anything around you. It was a warning sign for me; I didn't learn anything from it, nor did it change me in any noticeable way, besides that I will not be risking my life with such stuff as DOC anymore, I told myself to just be more careful, I still use drugs regularly (although it took a while to slow it down to a lesser extent). Learning from your mistakes is what makes you stronger, not hiding from them, at least for me. I got what I wanted to know.

Experience:DMT: 200mg 1/5 changa - Bad yet glorious trip,"Last night had the most terrifying experience i had in my whole life. Took a breakthrough dose of Changa and decided to experience it without lying down and. Was just standing there in my kitchen with open eyes. At first the real world started to wrap around me with almost mechanical visuals. Time started to stand still, getting faster and slower at the same time. at this time i thought i overdosed. I sat down at the table and felt all my racing thoughts become one elastic membrane covering the inside of my head. None of the thoughts were readable or making any sense they were just there melted together for eternity. The only familiar feeling i had was paralyzing fear and i couldn't get rid of. the moment i tried to figure out where the fear comes from the trip only intensified while digging deeper and deeper towards the source of the fear. At that point i closed my eyes. and a entity showed up. he was definitely male. he was gorgeous in his unhuman beauty and we started to arm wrestle. come on fucker i thought while he was showing himself to me and the complexity he was representing generating those fearsome emotions. We basically stared at each other. He was showing himself as the ultimate enemy i had to beat and defeat and me experiencing the terror he was inducing to me. Then i opened my eyes. Just to check whats going on outside and after i closed them again he never came back but those feelings of fear and terror never left. that's when i thought: ""is this going to last forever? which drove me even more into panic. The kitchen was drifting at a never before experienced intensity and the clock was standing still. I closed my eyes again and he wasn't there anymore. Instead i started to be overwhelmed by unstructured biological goo like visuals. Some sort of organic dark landscape wrapping around myself. It looked like my consciousness was made of millions plastic bags and set on fire and started melting like a plastic bag does. The terror in my head only intensified again since i started to feel those melting plastic constructs as physical pain or sensation in the back of my head and behind my eyes. At this point i lost it. I wanted to scream and thoughts connected to my family and closest friends sleeping in their rooms a few meters away. Are they aware of my suffering in the kitchen? ""Should i wake my friend up and seek comfort and relief from this torment i put myself upon me?"" The only thought was keeping me alive was that its a substance and the effects are getting weaker and will come to an end at some point. Finally the intensity of the experience started to fade somewhat resulting in an afterglow that lasted a long time. The afterglow felt somewhat like the sum of all my fears were extracted from me and and were floating aside of me. Interfering with it made those fears creep upon me again so i let left it alone. Since that moment the accumulated demons simply faded away slowly leaving a feeling of being proud for withstanding this madness. After that i went to bed and hugged my gf and tried to go to sleep. but it was not possible. I still had the images in my head and the terror i experienced. all this happened at 1:45AM and lasted till 2:50, finally falling asleep around 5:00AM am woke up literally few minutes ago and had to write this down. When i looked at the mirror this morning a wide grin appeared. Submitted by - Antiharmonix","['anxiety', 'autonomous entities', 'delusion', 'synaesthesia', 'time distortion']",704
Experience:80mg - progressing deeper into states of unity and interconnectedness,"I've had states of unity and interconnectedness with 80 mgs of DMT, hit me very hard, but I came to the realization with the fact that our visible universe is not the only thing in existence, but rather the set of universe was that it has been made me consciousness itself. I felt being everything and nothing at the same time. As I was so much more than just a universe but there still was other entities besides me. As it progressed I got into even deeper states of understanding the experience of consciousness until I finally reached to the bottom of the essence of my self-existence. I realized that the original experience of being everything must have been flawless when interpreted to reality. I came to this conclusion partly because even though it might sound logically coherent, it is still something that cannot be proven or disproven with our current knowledge and technology, so it must be only a self-induced guess. It's not a valid theory, hypothesis or even a model, though if experienced without this knowledge can lead to severely altered personality afterwards.

"Experience:DMT (75 mg, smoked) - Bad trip with illustration","Peaked on Aphex Twin - Vordhosbn. WAS NIGHTMARISH. It was like some lovecraftian nightmare shit. Like an abstract Zdzislaw Beksinski painting. BIG mistake. Should've vetted the music more thoroughly, plus I need stuff that's more familiar. Between, 5-15 seconds I deliberated internally if I should change the music or kinda roll with it, and it just got worse and so I kinda leaped out of bed, got on my laptop, and put on some familiar chill music. That was good, made things a lot better. Felt a lot warmer, more comfortable, cozy. Then I played Brother Android - Stars Come Out, and that was VERY nice, but I still had kind of nightmarish imagery, I still have some in the back of my mind right now. I'm going to listen to more cozy brother android music, I need a much LOWER bpm for a good trip, my heart rate is like, reliant on the BPM, and so when I was listening to Aphex twin, the uncertainty and the high BPM made my heart rate rise and ALARMED me. Then I had the nightmarish imagery. When I had my eyes open and was changing the songs on my laptop, the folds in my covers looked like soft animal skulls. Had to do my best to ignore what was in my peripheral vision. Future reference: Low BPM, COZY, try some lyrics? Remember, you can always have more but you cant have less. Had way too much DMT and was listening to unfamiliar FAST erratic music. Big mistake, the other break core songs were kind of chill, and I was rolling with it, it was just intense visuals, but once we got to Aphex Twin, shit just went south. Plus I was peaking on the Aphex song. Scene from bad trip I'm still kinda on the comedown, so I'm just gonna roll with it and then go to bed. Once I'm completely good, going to put on more Brother Android, other chill stuff, and ride it out. Okay, so its probably about 20 minutes since first draw, and about 12 minutes since I got out of the nightmare zone, I'm feeling kinda miffed and considering doing some more to some better music because I don't want to end the night on a bad trip with nightmare imagery ykno, I want some cozy DMT before I snooze. So I'm gonna go for six consecutive draws and put on a cozy song and report back. Yeah, it wasn't too much, but it was pretty bad. I say, 5/10 intensive visuals, so if I was watching a movie with 7 sunglasses on, but it was still the fucking nightmarish imagery, not as bad as before though, it got better if I relaxed. My muscles kept tensing up when I relaxed them the trip got a little better. I came to terms with it and kind just rode it out, even with very soothing music on. It was kind of strange. I have the most soothing song I know on loop right now, im getting kind of bored of it, but like... im afraid of every other song right now. Uhm, whenever I moved to get more comfortable it felt like I was falling, like I was in free-fall for brief moments. Very weird trip. What did I learn: Wait a week in between trips minimum Have a complete playlist set up, curated for 30-45 minutes of straight chillin. Low BPM, soothing, spacious. Do sets of 4, do 4 draws, kinda sit for 5-10 minutes, if feeling fine do 4 more, sit for 5-10, and if feeling fine do 4 more. I don't think I'm going to push past 12 next time. Next time keep timestamps Submitted by - Consumerofdrugs","['autonomous entities', 'external hallucination', 'geometry', 'internal hallucination']",808
Experience:75mg DMT - Experiencing Death,"I packed the slider with somewhere between 60-80mg of DMT. The DMT was from the second pull of my extraction, white “sticky” crystals. In comparison my previous trips used DMT of lower purity (yellow goo), and the difference was very noticeable. At higher purity the body load was much less. Previous trips I had a sort of mental block that prevented me from taking the big hits that would send me to hyperspace. That block was gone; I was ready to experience the full power of DMT. My roommate is sitting next to me, ready to take the bong from me. I readied myself and took the first hit. It was massive, to full lung capacity. As I held it it I felt it start to creep up on me. What was I doing? I reminded myself to take a second hit. I took it as things started to lose meaning around me. For a few seconds it persisted like this. I could feel the DMT on the cusp of unleashing itself, like standing near the edge of a cliff. My roommate took the bong. It was bizarre, seeing person I didn't recognize took an object I didn't understand from me. I didn't make it to hit 3. I feel my thoughts being shut down by the DMT. Complete and utter ego death hits. It was comparable in intensity to 100+mg 4aco trips I had experienced. Everything is beyond comprehension. At first I wonder what is happening to me, I forgot I took DMT or what DMT was. I thought I was dying. Terror creeps up, the primal fear of death. I lose all concept of “me”. My entire existence is this singularity. Everything is me and I am everything. I am terrified but fear nothing. I accept my death. I hear an EKG flatline throughout the trip. I see my own fear quantified and interpreted into intense overriding geometry. I am recursive. I see my consciousness reflected in hallucination. Time means nothing, I am in this state for an eternity. Death is endless. I blink. I am standing at a carnival, it is unfamiliar to me. If I remembered anything, I might have thought I was dead. It is night.Off to the right in the distance I see a Ferris wheel adorned with red and yellow lights. I am standing in the center of a lot of carnival games. To my right is a target shooting game, to my left is a ring toss area. I walk over to the ring toss. All their prizes are varying sizes of stuffed Pikachus. I start to play until I feel myself being pulled away. I feel my thoughts slowly return as I try to process what happened. I enter this limbo state of fear and confusion again. Broken disjointed thoughts slowly formulate into coherence. I start seeing the room around me again. It takes me a few moments to realize I am back in reality and alive. I am sweating and shaking a little. The first words I say are “Holy Shit”. I was so glad to be alive. I get up from the chair I was in, drink some water and curl up in bed grasping what just happened. I tell my roommate the story. It was intense, yet I was euphoric. I felt like I had been given back by life. I was glad it happened but still shaky from the experience. According to my roommate I was looking around the room throughout the trip, completely silent with no signs of what was happening inside. He had given me a stuffed Pikachu sometime during the trip, I thought it was fascinating how that interpreted into hallucination I watch an episode of Adventure Time and fall asleep.

Experience:50mg - Truth,"I packed 50mg mixed with a tiny amount of weed for preparation. Earlier i did 30 mg. I think the dmt comeup is heavily perception based. I think the negative comeup I was experiencing before was fear related. This comeup felt incredibly clean. The dmt is #goodshit. There was a distinct presence felt the entire time. My visuals were a mix of geometry and inexplicable hallucinations. I felt as if I was passing through a tunnel of sorts throughout the trip, I see what appears to be architecture and defined rooms colored orange and white. This is a very similar ""place"" ive experienced before on DMT. At one point I was in a partially transluctent room in the stars. The edges where visible by where they bended the light of the surrounding cosmos. Early into my breakthrough I met an entity, who acted as a narrator of sorts for part of the trip. The entity was humorous, and seemed to find my presence humorous. I experienced egodeath, complete oneness with the current moment and all that I was experiencing. The entity seemed amused at my lack of comphrension while going through egodeath. There was an irony in the significance I put in breaking through under the lens of my ego and how much I could absorb directly. The entity told/imparted on me wisdom about the cosmos and the universe and I absorbed it silently. There was a strong sense that the universe is a lot stranger than what we experience. Something Rick and Morty esque like the universe being a computer program that some 5th dimensional being left running on their computer seemed entirely possible. I certainly felt that way as I was seeing this alien world. As I started to come down I tried to ask about knowledge that I could apply to my life. The being was reproachful, ""they always seek personal gain"". I recognized my mistake, which felt incredibly silly to even ask due to the insignificance of my earthly worries. From here, the trip shifted towards a dialogue. I wondered if the being was telling me what I wanted to hear. I started to challenge what the being was saying to me. Not challenge, but try my hardest to analyze what it was saying and hold it to logical scrutiny. I noticed a plot structure in my trip and wondered if the positive feelings it was giving me were a form of wish fulfillment, or at least constructed by my conscience. I found myself feeling unity with the universe, having no fear of death, and having no uncertainty, my beliefs weren't being contradicted. This is probably because of past experiences. I realized that I was constructing the entire filter of my perception, as long as there was an I there would be that filter. Furthermore, everything that happens in the universe is completely insignificant yet perfectly meaningful. I thought before that overanalyzing an entity might diminish the effect of the trip. I was incredibly wrong. By engaging the entity, which I think was the embodiment of the trip, I learned so much more than I ever would've otherwise. My skepticism brought great joy. My trip changed, I had stepped off a train following a fixed course from start to finish that was predetermined by the person I was when I entered the trip. There is great importance in the truth, in what is. Truth is one of the highest virtues to strive for, and the entity seemed to respect me much more for having asked it questions and remained skeptical than blankly accepting the course of the trip. Then I wondered if the trip was still being constructed by my conscience. Was my questioning scripted in from the beginning of the trip, was it just another part of the trip experience? I thought it was likely, since i already held truth in high regard. For awhile, after I came back from my breakthrough, I talked to the entity while intermittently meditating. i felt like the trip lasted a long time after I came down, I could sense the entity for at least 10-20 minutes. The entity at one point told me my entire life was a wish fulfillment. I take this to mean that I am determined, driven by needs and desired hardcoded into my brain. It also meant that life was a continuous gift, life is joy in itself.

Experience:50mg - Demon faces and dÃ©jÃ  vu,"T + Minutes:Seconds T + 00:00 - I loaded up a dose, and began to inhale. I tried to take the entire hit in one puff. Im starting to think stretching it out is the way to go… T + 00:05 - I have kept a smile on my face and happy thoughts in my head, but instead of enhanced colors and wavy lines, All the color drained out of the room, and everything went black and grey and white. Everything in my room started to become indescribable in shape, and jagged and constant in geometry. As the world started to get stranger, I remember my tower shaped fan stretching up to, and absorbing into the ceiling. It still remained attached to the ground, and it took on an odd texture. It started moving about the room as if attached to a rail attached to the ceiling. I was finally consumed by the grey geometry and everything went black... T + 00:40 - I ""awoke"" in my own mind. I was staring at an incredibly angry face that seemed exactly like a Chinese demon, or Chinese dragon face. Exaggerated eyebrows, long outwardly curved fangs, and cartoonish eyes and facial hair. Very traditional in Chinese style. I could only see this face and a background of a texture that seemed shaped and to flow like fire, but moved in a more predictable and solid way. T + 00:45 - He is shaking me around. I feel no connection to my body or limbs, but I can feel him shaking my ""soul"" back and forth very violently. He suddenly throws me to another face, similar in style and design, but different. I can feel my ""soul"" being shaken, he throws me again, to yet another face. I can feel myself bouncing around as if I am the ball a pinball machine. I felt shaped like a ball too… or just a face anyway... Every throw increases in speed and intensity. I spend less and less time with each face as I speed up, but it seemed to last for years, even still. It was such a shocking experience, I blacked out eventually. T + 05:00 - I woke up in my room, alone. The color was back, but everyone was gone.. I felt incredibly disappointed and morose. As I got up to get off of my bed to turn off the lights to go to sleep, my door opened and a man who's face i cannot remember if I recognized pointed a gun at me and shot me in the head. I felt the bullet puncture through the right side of the top of my head and push through my brain, stopping in the middle somewhere, and I blacked out pretty immediately. At least it didn't hurt. T + 06:00 - I woke up in my room, again, alone. I was pretty freaked out by what had just happened and I was just happy it was over, and focused less on the idea that people weren't around. Before I got a chance to get up off of my bed, my door opened and the man pulled a gun and shot me again. This time on the left side of my head. I felt in go in similarly, but at a different angel. Still with no pain, just sensation. I, again, fell out of consciousness. T + 07:00 - I woke up in my room. My friends were all there, but I was wary about the legitimacy of the reality I was in and just sort of stared at everyone awkwardly for a while, keeping my bedroom door in the corner of my eye. The world was still grey and geometric. Unmoving and jagged.. The color started to seep into the room and textures took on a more friendly and realistic form. The borders and outlines of objects became softer and more realistic as well. I abandoned the idea that I was still neck deep in experience, and started to relax. T + 10:00 - I attempted to explain to my friends what I had gone through but it was difficult because DMT will often make it difficult to express my thoughts outwardly while I am still under its spell. If there was a lesson to be learned, I think it was that one can only really protect themselves. In the end you cannot rely on anyone to hold you up, indefinitely. Another idea would be that no matter how hard I try to control or force a good experience, it does not seem possible. This is unique in my experiences with psychedelics. Usually I can force myself into a good state of mind and thusly trip. DMT seems to be more powerful than my will, at least, until after the peak. It seems one must really just relax, and let whatever is going to happen, happen, with no resistance at all. It's very interesting… Submitted by - Salem","['changes in felt bodily form', 'colour replacement', 'geometry', 'internal hallucination', 'tactile hallucination', 'transformations']",981
Experience:DMT (~50mg) + Cannabis - Geometric Angels,"I measured out 100mg of DMT and mixed it together in a bowl of weed. Me and my brother sat on a bed together and passed the bowl back and forth until it was gone. We took special care to hold in each hit as long as we could, but also to get the bowl done as quickly as possible. By the time we were done, the world was already very strange, but that's to be expected with DMT This was a very unique experience and I have never had one like it since. I felt very confused, and I wanted to purge, but was able to hold back. In the end, I sort of wish I had. With open eyes, solid objects seemed to ebb and flow leaving beautiful sparkling, wavy, softly stuttering and smooth tracers of themselves in the air. I have searched the depths of my vocabulary, and I posses no real power to describe to anyone how beautiful everything seemed to be. The flowing transparency, the slow wave everything held. It was magical; so very dream/ghost like, and easily the most beautiful change in landscape I have ever seen on psychedelics. Maybe not necessarily the craziest or most intense and vivid, or even colorful, but by far the most beautiful. I have experienced nothing like it before or since, sadly. My psychedelic posters did as expected; they waved and flowed in the ways you would expect them to while sober, based on the geometry and shape of the designs made by the artist. My own body seemed to be entirely see through, as tho I was a specter, when I examined my own hands. It is still very hard to describe. At the peak of the experience the corner of my room glowed bright white, brighter than any light I have ever seen before. The light originated from the floor in the far corner of the room and grew so intense it became quite hard to look at. I managed to keep my eyes fixated through the familiar confusion and disorientation of the DMT experience, and I was very glad I had done so. A sold neon and glowing triangle appeared in the middle of the light as though it was laying on my floor. and another one just to the side of it. Out of that shape, spawned a different shape of similar structure, but it was a different color and had different angles. Each shape quickly unfolded out of itself to revile two amorphous humanoid shaped kaleidoscopic angels. I chose this term because of the biblical way these changing, neon, geometric, figures seemed to shake me to my core. The very presence of these creatures weakened my body in a blissful way. My entire body was shaking, but it wasn't painful or uncomfortable. It was as if i had been filled with awe of the raw power of these creatures. They were even difficult to look at directly, they seemed to be too beautiful for my eyes. I am not religious in almost an sense of the word, but this very much seemed like biblical recounts of being in the presence of a celestial body, without the halos, wings, robes and human faces. Although I'm not sure those particular details are in the bible, that seems to be the artistic portrayal. These were nothing like that aesthetically, but they held an incredibly powerful presence. They seemed to be separately sentient of me and from each other. They remained in a static position in my room. No matter what direction I looked, my brain had projected these creatures to be in that exact position in space (The same as the origination point for the light), much as if they were solid matter, and not simple over eye geometry. They retained a constant humanoid shape but the geometry and the colors that structured them changed very rapidly. They seemed to speak in an echoing in a language that consisted of different tones and beeps. Not unlike R2D2's voice, but without the squeals. These creatures grew in size, color, and intensity and the beeping seemed to get more.. encouraging? As the urge to purge grew more powerful. As I resisted they grew smaller. The urge would come up again, and they would become… excited? and seemed to be disappointed that I had swallowed the urge back and they disappeared completely into themselves, taking the radiant white light with them. I laid on my bed, curled into a ball and shaking as though I had hypothermia. My brother was very concerned and I was aware of his presance at this point, I had to pull myself together and tell him the shaking was the product of the intensity of awe I was under. It was entirely a good thing, and incredibly humbling. My brother was only able to note on the fact that he thought my poster was trying to eat him, because a ""happy-face fractal tentacle"" poster I had, had reached its colorful tendrils out and was using them to try and grab onto my brother and consume him, assimilating him into the poster. The after glow was as beautiful as the come up, but it did not seem as though sharing the bowl with my brother had caused any kind of similarities in any way, shape or form. DMT seems to be a very diverse experience. I have noticed that mixing it with weed causes it to have a much higher body load, in a heavy, but not necessarily good or bad way. This happens almost consistently every time I mix DMT and Marijuana. Most beautiful visuals Ive ever had. Sharing the experience seems to produce no notable effects. I think purging may have intensified the experience. I'm glad I didn't as I remained on my bed the entire time.

Experience:40mg smoked - Ego death and unity with a friend,"This was my first DMT trip, it began by preparing a bong with 40mg of DMT mixed evenly across a small amount of marijuana. Once this had been done we headed upstairs and made ourselves comfortable in a darkened room on the bed. I compiled a short musical playlist for my trip which was comprised of Friction and Mt Eden (1), (2) which I intended to listened to through my head phones during the experience. Once this was done, Josikins began to light the DMT mix for me and I started to rip the bong. After taking a few hits from the bong, my visual field suddenly became extremely altered. It appeared as if I was looking through a psychedelic kaleidoscope spiral of repeating shards of inconsistently shapes triangles. These shapes did not contain colors but a continuously repeated image of my vision. As this increased in its intensity it became clear that I could no longer continue inhaling the smoke due to a complete loss in my ability to function normally. I ceased smoking the DMT and the the bong was taken away from me as I slowly collapsed backwards on the bed with my eyes closed. At this point I experienced total ego death. I had no knowledge of self or even physical being. All that existed was the music and the most amazing level 6 geometry comprised of intricate patterns with thousands of brilliant hues and shades that fluctuated and pulsed to the beat. This continued for several minutes until I slowly started to regain physical feeling. I realized that I felt slightly damp, then suddenly it felt like gravity was pulling me down, as I started falling into the position which I awoke from above. I sat up at the edge of the bed and opened my eyes, distortions such as visual drifting along with geometric patterns still covered my whole field of vision. I then found that the damp feeling was due to the bong being spilt slightly on me while I was tripping but I hadn't felt it until I began to reconnect with my body. At this point my friend was also sitting next to me in the same position. I began to see a semi transparent image of myself over laid on top her. I then felt a profound sense of oneness with Josikins which lasted only minutes but during this time I felt that we were like two halves of the same whole. I realized that we were two different people but yet somehow deep down we were the same being. Once I had sobered up enough we proceeded to head downstairs to the living room and immediately began to play the popular board game known as ""cluedo"". Throughout this I still felt a body high and minor distortions continued in my field of vision for approximately ten minutes.

Experience:40mg (smoked) - The planet became a watermelon,"This was my first DMT experience. I was inhaling DMT via a bong, but as it was intended for someone else it had tobacco in it. When I took over, it was very hard to keep down; like when you’re so full but you have to force the next forkful down for whatever reason. After a few deep breaths of the stuff, my friend (Josikins) just told me “One more pull, man”, and it felt like I was in a Hollywood film and was up against it. I inhaled and rushed the bong, and instead of inhaling smoke that tastes like burning plastic, it was like I inhaled a dog of crisp sea air, and I could sense sparkles and every salt particle. That’s about when some visuals resembling a monochrome dream catcher materialized in front of me, taking up my entire field of vision. Colours quickly filled this and I was in. I was lifted out of my body very quickly, and landed in another world, one made entirely of multi-colored, luminous, ever-changing ‘generic digital’ or LED lights, though despite literally everything being made of this light (land, sky, everything within) I could make out that I was wandering around a walled maze (just like the 3D maze screensaver on Windows 98, but made entirely out of ever-changing color). I was only here for a matter of seconds. I then saw a ‘blocky’ wall of light move like a wave from left to right – if ocean waves were on Minecraft they would look like this, very blocky and simple. The wave had a pair of cartoon eyes, like Goofy or Donald Duck or whatever. After this I was drifting from the planet’s surface and ended up looking at a bright orange globe from space. After this I heard someone in the room say something, so I opened my eyes and I saw in splitscreen reality on the upper half, and my DMT trip carrying on without my attention beneath. That was kind of like when you’re swimming in goggles and you lift your head out of the water just enough so that you can see above and below surface. The real world was rather dull in comparison, so I closed my eyes and carried on. I drifted away some more and then saw that the planet was inside a watermelon, vines and all, and I had just exited the planet’s atmosphere like I imagine anything else would, but the atmosphere here was quite clearly a watermelon. I drifted further away and everything was dark. For some reason I then felt a little sad at how few people, in the grand scheme of things, have and would ever experience a DMT trip. When I’m tripping I often think of how something like a DMT trip (or any psychedelic experience) undoubtedly started the earliest religions. The evidence was… evident! So I think that explains why I then saw an army of cavemen, made entirely of the aforementioned, ever-changing light, carrying a banner of ever-changing color, march proudly towards the orange globe in deep space. I reckon I was convincing myself that DMT and the whole psychedelic experience will carry on as long as there are even a few proponents. After this revelation my trip stopped; reality appeared to have been ‘poured’ over my trip, over my field of vision. There were even vibrantly colored visuals on the extreme periphery of my vision for a few seconds after. All in all, it was a nice evening in.

Experience:30mg (smoked) DMT - The Monolith,"This is a condensed experience of my first breakthrough. As always set and setting apply for blast off, with one other person (also doing DMT with me), great music, nice and warm. Ash layer at bottom of bowl, precisely weighed 30mg (0.001g scales) and another fat layer of ash above, hold flame over to melt and then allow some contact. Best use a tor jet lighter. First toke 0:00 Soon as i breathe out, a wave of of sedative Sedation euphoria spreads across my body. Heart rate noticeably increased. color enhancement present, colors of golden reds and emerald greens. No cognitive difference, very shroomy. acuity enhancement present. Second toke 0:30 As i take the second hit, visuals start becoming very apparent. My bong seems very strange. Magnification and depth perception distortions are present. Everything is different but the same. As i hold in the second toke, can feel my blood pressure rise (heart starts to pound but not uncomfortable). body gravity changes. Walls start breathing, melting and drifting. Geometric patterns present upon surface, vivid chrysanthemums. I look at my friend and i can see all his muscles and bones on his face. I ask if i should attempt to breakthrough with one last toke, he says im ready, i say im ready. I take the next toke. Third toke 1:00 The bong doesn't look real anymore, everything is shimmering and glistening at a high frequency. I have vibrating vision and intense visual static. My eyes begin to cross and shake with double vision and i see all the particles that make up the room shaking until they part like the waters of moses and i see everything for how it truly is without interference. 1:40+ The world before me open eyes is my old room but laced with highly algorithmic patterns 3-Dimensional textures, cogworks and dimensional gravitational dips in the walls. I close my eyes and i see a huge tunnel of kaleidoscopes with recursion that are twisting and contorting into shapes and positions i have never seen. Pyramidal structures and i feel myself being sucked upwards with a perception of decreased weight and changes in felt bodily form into this wormhole. Heart rate has stopped, dilation of time is severe, seconds feel like eternities. (i cant make sense of time from now on, but the whole experience lasted 7-8mins) Estimated time 2:15+ I see these gatekeeper entities autonomous entities speaking in weird tones of ancient according, made of vast fractals and they guard this white light, the end of the tunnel. In pure shock and awe to what i am seeing i surrender myself to the overwhelming euphroia and visuals. I feel empathy, love, and sociability enhancement and i surpass onto the breakthrough, the hyperspace, the torus dome. Estimated time 2:30+ Complete dissociation from the room around me, eyes open and closed generate same imagery. I enter this huge, vast dome made from linear sections crafted with trillions of these hieroglyphic eyes in rainbow color, moving too and fro. In the middle of this dome was a monolithic entity in the shape of a man beast. Arms stretched out, palms to the sky. With two high intensity energy pulsations wrapped around each other erupting form the beasts third eye which join into the domes structure. Search Torus dmt structure, is exactly what i saw. Im in complete astonishment from what im seeing, accompanied with auditory sounds of cybernetic breathing with some angelic symphony of dmt angels blasting their orchestral sounds. There is no ""I"" anymore it has dissipated into the hyperspce. As with those who have done dmt, its very hard to recall the breakthrough Amnesia, as it feels like a waking dream among an invisible landscape. After the peak subsided, it went down back through the layers of intensity the colors and patterns slowly pull away from you without even notice and your returned to the shroom visual level again. I spoke as much as i could about it, wrote some descriptive poetry and drew what i had saw. Estimated time: 7-8mins + Coming down, huge sense of enlightenment, i cant stop smiling and i even cry from what i had experienced. Smoked a nice fat spliff while collating my thoughts and still lingering int he afterglow which lasts for a good 20-30mins especially after a breakthrough, and talked about what had happened and my interpretations. The trip was so meaningful to me, if not one of the most advanced psychedelic experiences i have had to date other than my more recent breakthroughs.

Experience:25mg DMT - Your wall can't save you,"A few days prior, 95% isopropyl alcohol was used to wash the inner walls of a DMT jar. This jar looked empty, save some yellow gooey crystals on the side and in the corners, but it seemed very cumbersome to try and scrape the yellow goo off the walls of the jar, so I washed the walls and let it evaporate. I am doing this casually, and am hoping to only acquire a small dose to help me drift off to sleep peacefully. I scraped up the contents of the jar and placed it in my DMT pipe.

Experience:40mg DMT - Second breakthrough,"T + 00:00 - I load up my first hit into a foil cup I prepared, and begin to vaporize the substance, holding a foil tube above which I start to inhale through. T + 00:05 - I have held in the vapor for a few seconds, but my lungs quickly start to burn and I involuntarily cough as my friend loads my second hit. T + 00:10 - I vaporize and inhale the second hit, my lungs still on fire. My ears start to ring and my peripheral vision gets blurry. I again can only hold it in for a few seconds before I cough. T + 00:20 - As soon as I inhale to third hit, I no longer can feel the pain in my lungs. My breathing gets deeper. Time seems as though it is slowly down drastically. I hold for a few seconds and exhale. T + 00:30 - I fall backwards onto my bed which I was sitting on. I look up and around as the room begins to drift, melt, and morph. The pattern on my ceiling changes colors, the white lines splitting apart into their constituent colors of red, green, and blue. T + 00:45 - I instantly am filled with a feeling of pure panic and dread. I am telling myself that something is terribly wrong, and that what is happening is very, very bad. I feel as though I am going to die. T + 01:00 - The feeling of impending doom continues as the pattern on my ceiling now begins to come off the ceiling itself and morph into the tiles of the floor of another world. Once the tiles are completely formed, the world that the tiles are contained within forms as well, but as soon as I try to look at it, I go back to my room. T + 01:15 - This visual cycle repeats as I begin to feel even more scared and panicked than I did before. Every time I try to think about what is happening, my train of thought is cut short. This makes me panic even more. I try to think again, but my train of thought is cut even shorter. And shorter. And shorter... T + 01:30 - This time, when the ceiling morphs into the other reality, it remains. I can finally look at it. At the same time this happens, I can no longer form thoughts. I can no longer remember. There is no time. There is no me. I am simply the universe, observing itself. I am on top of a mayan-style pyramidal structure, a vast expanse of thick jungle below me, with a river running through it. Below my feet is an intricate tessellation of tiles. In the sky is bright orange-yellow setting sun, casting a brilliant orange hue on the entire landscape. On my left and right are a series of raised pillars extending the length of the top of the pyramid. In between each pillar stands a being. They are all identical, humanoid in shape with bright orange skin and gold headdresses and jewelry. They had features very similar to artistic depictions of certain Hindu gods. They are trying to communicate, but not verbally. They are doing some sort of dance which conveys a feeling rather than an actual message comprised of logical information. I am still merely observing. I am unable to form thoughts. T + 10:00 - The process of my ceiling morphing into an alternate reality described in the beginning begins to reverse very rapidly until I am completely back in my room once again. I am still getting very intense visuals which prevent me from moving with much coordination, so I only lie on my bed. T + 15:00 - I am finally able to get up, though I am still experiencing fairly strong visuals. My friend asks if I’m okay and I am able to respond. I get up to dispose of the equipment used for the vaporization, but am very off balance, as I feel like I’m being pulled from side to side even though I am walking straight. T + 20:00 - I sit back down and attempt to process the experience I just had. I am not able to however, due to the visuals distracting me. I instead must wait until they are completely or at least mostly over. T + 30:00 - The visuals have almost completely ceased, and I begin to process what I remember happening. I go through it in my mind a few times as to forget as little of the experience as possible. T + 40:00 - I describe the experience to my friend, as I figure that that will help solidify my recollection of it. T + 60:00 - I am pretty much back to normal at this point. I go get something to eat and go back to watching TV. I feel different though. I feel rejuvenated. I feel happier.

"Experience:DMT: 1,1mg 1/5 changa x3 â The continuation","Session one: After last nights trip I was terrified to explore and meet the entity I met yesterday so I asked my friend if he want to be with me during the next journey. He agreed. Like last time I refused to lay down and close my eyes and just did it in my comfy chair. Took the pipe in my mouth and lightened it up. The effects started to come up very quickly The room started to change and intense drifting occurred. Digital like patterns started to form on all objects except the walls. Those were covered with beautiful Aztec like visuals that were fading in and out from the walls. All my thoughts started to melt together again forming a clump of what I thought is my perception of myself. The fearsome entity showed up again accompanied with a familiar sound similar to a siren with organic bleep like nuances. “he was back” I thought but for some reason it didn’t try to overwhelm me from the start. Instead it was just blinking and sparkling around me. Poking and taunting me to see if I would engage with him. I didn’t because I knew its power and how he can influence the trip if I start to mess with him. When it saw that I am not going to engage, the sounds faded and he started to hide somewhere behind my left shoulder. The sound got quieter and quieter and he was gone, But I knew he was still there he just hid himself. “We are not alone in this room” I told to P. He just smiled and his smile felt somewhat relaxing. P. closed his eyes again and continued to meditate. When he was sitting there he was surrounded by an golden aura making him appear bigger than he actually was. The effects started to weaken leaving an relaxed mindset since I didn’t get into that state I was yesterday. But the entity was there. I did meet him again. Session two: I still felt the body high and tactile sensations from the experience from and hour ago. I told P. that I want to do it again. My intention was to meet the entity again. And see what I can learn from it. P. was excited since he new that the second experience within short time will be more intense and he told me that. I took the pipe, loaded it with the changa and smoked it. Again digital patterns emerged but the frightening sound of the fearsome entity came up faster and louder and I thought he’s going to show himself in full power now. It was an very similar experience like last night. A wave of violet power started to cover me from the bottom up to my chest. I felt the terror again and fear started to take over my mind intensifying the siren like sound. P. saw my struggle but didn’t say anything. After that I finally managed to identify the entity. It was fear. Simply like that. The personalization of all my fears creeped upon me.. I managed to burp out to P. “it is here again and it’s stronger, Its fear”. He told me that fear is one of the two basic values that drives all humanity and that the other one is love, and went back to meditating. I liked the concept since I was looking for some weapon or method to defend myself from it. So I embraced love starting to feeling it. Love was felt by me as another powerful entity. It even had its own distinctive sound. A constant high pitched tone with lover pulsating nuances not of frightening nature. I was amazed how warm and calming it is. Although the fear never left. Fear and love started to dance together in some sort of harmony and I started to feel somewhat like an observer. I allowed those two powers to cover me giving a feeling of pulsating cold and warm sensation shifting in my body. I broke through into an alternate world at this point. I could see the energy floating in the room, felt that P. and me are the same being, He looked glorious sitting there in Lotus position surrounded by a good vibe golden aura, and I was wondering if this is happening? Can I believe in the events unfolding before my eyes and in my mind or will the belief that the energy is real hurt my sanity in some way. P. opened his eyes smiled And asked: ‘’Who am I?‘’ the moment he spoke those words the dread got stronger and the violet wave started to come up higher i was somehow scared he could be in control of the events that were happening and was not sure of his intentions anymore. But his smile calmed me down again and the demon backed off a little. “Everything” I said and it made sense for me at this point since i felt the whole world is just one single projection of some higher consciousness. My thoughts started to race and form concepts witch were new to me. I will not write them down here since I still have to deal and process them. And are an topic on its own. The effects started to fade, leaving a surprisingly strong body high. I felt like on MDMA the whole time shaking from cold until the next session. P. asked me if I want a blanket. “No” I said since I knew it wont make any difference. I was amazed and scared for my sanity at the same time since the experience was so powerful and meaningful to me. It was the trip of my lifetime. Used many psychedelics within last 3 years and had lot of experiences but this blew me out of my socks. Session three: Let's find out what happens, and try to sustain being in this beautiful alternate reality. I was still high and stimulated from the experience during the afterglow. The euphoria and ecstasy didn’t weaken a bit. I put the pipe in my mouth and hit it. The room stated to change rapidly. Being covered by those beautiful patterns again. I had a much calmer mindset at this point and hoped to meet fear again but it was not there. Instead i did hear the constant high, warm and calming tone. I was love at his point, or even god…I could not grasp any thoughts in order to read them, they all formed a single universal thought that I knew made sense even when I couldn’t read or understand it. I’ve got kind off sad since I was left alone with P. and love, missing the fear. Funny how much more interesting and fascinating and vivid in color and form it was. Love was “boring” compared to fear. At this point I just started to wait out the effects and looked at the room visualized my thought processes a bit on closed eyes and started to talk with P. about the overall experience. The changa world is truly unique and full of dualism I never experienced on any other substance. The fact that I kept my eyes open and had no music at all only intensified the experience for sure. The other dimension seen on closed eyes and the alternate real world are still the same for me though and I don’t feel much more enjoyment in having a winamp plugin running on my eyelids. The drug earned my utter respect and I will always think twice aswell as look for a reasonable intention before taking it.

"Experience:DMT (unknown dose, smoked) - It felt like I was on rails the whole time","My Second DMT trip. It felt like I was on rails the whole time, and first of all I entered a dodecahedron cavern made of bright visuals, ever-repeating itself, like a wallpaper but it was covering everything, including the moving parts and beings of the trip. It looked a little like the ‘eye’ of a peacock’s tail; bright pink, bright blue, and the filler was yellow. In the centre of the dodecahedron was a single stalactite, which melted into the floor, like sand in an hourglass. Then the cave started to morph, and became a giant lady looming above me, dancing something like the Can-Can, waving her skirt around her hips like they do, and her skirt obscured her face (all entirely made of the same visuals). After the cave morphed into the lady, I started moving sideways (to my right), automatically. The lady became a gentleman (a giant once more); suited and carrying a briefcase, though because he was walking past me his briefcase obscured my entire field of vision and so I didn’t see his face either. I then began to move slowly backwards. I knew that this meant I was past the peak of my trip, so I had to make the most of my time there. It was like I was standing on a platform in outer space, and in front of me were the visuals jumping up and down, looking like multi-colored television static. I asked the dancing shapes (without using my real voice) “This is lovely, how do we (humans) find you?” The shapes became flat, and I could see shapes among this enormous 3D plane resembling jets, like jet propulsion (so maybe this meant fly to another planet?). Each time the visuals made a shape, they went back to looking like static after about 1 second. I then asked “How do we get here?”, and the plain changed into endless mounds of countless human skulls (still multi-colored, and they didn’t seem sinister), which I took to mean ‘all of mankind will see this when they die’. I finally asked “What happens to us (mankind)?”, and the static changed into clouds and thrashing rain (which I thought meant a storm-based/water-based natural disaster as opposed to just lots of rain). I was continuing going backwards, and then saw that I had passed through a gateway, then the gate shut in front of me. I was travelling backwards into a cell, and though that I would end up in an upright coffin. I thought that was a bit sinister, but then to reassure me the DMT produced an entity in the shape of a Victorian nanny, who picked me up (I was looking at myself from the 3rd person for this), and kissed me on my forehead and placed me into a cot like a baby. This was very reassuring. When I was lying down in the coffin I was back in the room. As I was in total silence for this trip (having previously tripped while listening to Shpongle), I had some audio hallucinations; there was music that largely sounded like whale song but was deeper-sounding/more bass-y, but it was interspersed with pops like the kind you hear underwater.

Experience:120mg - Garden of The Gods,"Time: 20:00 (8pm) (+0:00 | 8pm) Parachute 60mg by wrapping the powder in 1/4 of a square of toiler paper and swallowing it. (+2:00 | 10pm) It's been long enough now and I haven't experienced any effects, so I decide to parachute another 60mg. This was probably a big mistake. (+2:30 | 10:30pm) Very sedated, slight trouble typing on the keyboard. Scalp and back are being filled with tingles. I remember describing them as ""tiny electrostatic shocks"". Very pleasant. (+3:30 | 11:30pm) Sitting, watching the chat when I realise that I have been keeping my head very still and that my vision was dream-like. I come to the abrupt realisation that I am tripping and my heart drops. I try to remember everything that lead up to this moment and am shocked that I took a drug, almost as though I was a very anti-drug person. My heart drops and I become extremely ashamed of myself. A few minutes later, I am relieved to find out that I am not anti-drug at all. (+4:00 : 12pm midnight) Visuals begin. Everything is brighter and the contents of my computer screen begin twisting and breathing very slightly. (+4:30 | 12:30am) Visuals are pretty strong. Every paragraph on the screen is breathing as though they had big lungs. Reading the PsychonautWiki IRC is very difficult as many of the posts are merging and the colours seem to be all mixed up, all the letters are jumping and falling, and my short-term memory is gone so I have to read the same post a few times to understand it. (+5:00 | 1am) Decide to go downstairs. I have a very small conversation with some people I know, trying very hard not to laugh at the fact that they had grass all over them from rolling in the garden. Head on back upstairs, which is difficult when the stairs are twisting and moving. (+6:00 | 2am) Start worrying that I should be asleep. I decide to pull an all-nighter and, for once, do what I want to do without worrying that I might be disturbing others' sleep. Tracers and after-images are very obvious. I keep putting my finger in front of my face and putting it down really quickly, with tracers lasting about half a second. Someone in the chat asks me if my mouse has a large tracer, and I reply with ""hold on, I'm having a bit of trouble getting to the mouse atm"". The person then saves the quote in tripbot. (+7:00 | 3am) My entire room is breathing, my computer screen looks as though someone poured gel over it. Very awake, very stimulated, but at the same time I've never been so tired. (+8:00 | 4am) The mirror is very interesting. When I stare at my eyes in the mirror, the rest of my face begins to transform and the corners of objects in my room become drawn with complex geometry. A recurring visual is a blue eye surrounded by a diamond, looking right at me. The eye looks a little like the All-seeing Eye. I decide that this is the eye of a God. (+9:00 | 5am) I go to lie down. The ceiling is all wobbly, the walls are breathing, everything is very three-dimensional. When I look in the mirror, my eyes are dry and my pupils are very large. When I try to think, I keep forgetting what I am thinking about and it takes me a few seconds to get back to the thoughts. (+9:30 | 6am) No luck in getting to sleep, so I go back to the computer. The computer screen looks as though it is running at a very low FPS rate, with the caret blinking very slowly. Time has slowed down dramatically. I can hear the sounds of people saying my name in another room but I know that they aren't real. (+11:30 | 8am) I sit by the window and look out. The building opposite me is breathing and all of the windows are wobbling. The grass of my garden is moving in circles and the leaves of the trees are shaking very quickly. The sky is filled with geometric patterns that look like lines and eyes are everywhere. Birds fly around, leaving long tracers which make a single bird look like three or four. The whole scene is very bright. I see people in the windows of the building opposite my window, but am not sure if they are real. In one window, I see a man pacing backwards and forwards, looking out of the window and down at the ground every few seconds. He eventually leaves, and I can hear him talking to me. In another window, I see the curtains lift themselves up and a woman look out and directly at me. I worry that she knows I'm on drugs and pretend to be reading a book. I sit here for an hour before going to lie down. While lying down, I begin to make false memories that feel extremely familiar. I begin inventing new words that I strongly believe were some of the first words I'd ever heard. They were of course false and the words did not exist. (+13:00 | 9am) I watch some YouTube videos. In one thumbnail, the image is a cliff with grass on it and water in the distance; the image comes alive, with the grass waving as though there is wind, and the water flowing realistically. I put my earphones in and watch the video which is trip music, and my mood and visions go according to the music; when the music becomes deep and slow, I get bad hallucinations of the cut on my thumb swelling and becoming a dark red while hearing voices in my head, and when the music picks up, I get a huge rush of euphoria and feel content with my life. (+17:00 | 1pm) Everyone in the house is now awake and I get very worried that they will notice I'm tripping, so I take a shower. Wow, what a bad idea. My hearing is gone so I cannot judge whether the water is running properly, and due to the hallucinations, the walls appear to be closing in. I am extremely anxious that I've lost relativity with time and that I will be in the shower for a very long time so I get out, dry myself and go back to my room. I constantly feel as though I am obviously tripping. (+18:00 | 2pm) I can hear everyone downstairs and they sound like they are moving very quickly, and eventually someone comes to me and begins talking. However, they are speaking very fast and it's hard to understand them, so I reply talking very quickly to which they reply ""are you alright?"" I become concerned that they know and say ""yeah, just tired."" They leave. (+19:00 | 3pm) I get food (a burger and some chips from McDonalds) and my God, it is disgusting; chips are dry, sauce is fucking disgusting, burger is tasteless. The only thing I could consume was my drink of Coca-Cola (perhaps it was the sugars?) I do not eat much at all. (+24:00 | 8pm) I realise that I can, to a certain extent, control the effects; I can slow down and speed up time as I wish; I can control the intensity of the colours I see and I can hallucinate whatever I wish. I use these 'powers' and hallucinate birds outside. I see how much I can speed up time. Having a lot of fun with my powers! If I stare at a particular object for longer than a second, I can see every detail in its texture. I spend the next day extremely tired, restless and exhausted. I find things entertaining that I previously found extremely boring. That night as I get in bed, I begin to think about my mother and how ill she is. I think about everything she has done for me. I begin to cry. The next day I spend some time with her and help her to clean her house.

Experience:30mg - Psychostimulant egodeath,"I decided to take AMT with two good friends of mine. I've taken a few research chemicals, and decided to give this one a go, as it was so easily available. When taking it, I was expecting a more psychedelic feel, but ended up with a stimulant effect instead. t +0h00m Take pill containing 30mg of AMT. t +0h45m I started to feel stimulated, had a sort of MDMA-like buzz setting in. I decided to try and do some of my college photography coursework, hoping that I'd have increased creativity, but was too easily distracted. My other friends then take their doses. One friend was on just AMT, the other on LSD and AMT. t +1h30m The LSD guy starts to come up. Me and the LSD friend go and have a bit of a dance on our own. At this point, I was feeling very euphoric, and couldn't stop giggling. t +2h00m The three of us, upon suggestions from our stoned friends, decided to go on a wander. We took a walk up to the top of a huge hill, where we could look over our whole town. We started giving each other history lessons, pretty enlightening. We then headed to our local playground, and all had a go on the swings. There’s a seat thing that you can sit on, and another person spins you around. We all had a go on that, but had to quit when it got a bit intense, and the LSD guy ended up throwing up. t +3h30m We headed back to my friend’s house. We decided to play Mario Kart with the stoners, which was incredible. I was still ridiculously giggly. I also was finding it hard to concentrate; in the middle of the game, near the end of a race, I just stopped driving with no reason why and preceded to fall into an uncontrollable ten minute long fit of laughter. I came near last in every game, unsurprisingly. Rainbow Road was intense. I started to trip at this point, and the walls were melting. My vision started getting very jittery (nystagmus, similar to the effect when someone takes a little too much MDMA), and I couldn’t focus on one thing; my eyes kept jumping around out of control. t +5h00m At this point, I started to feel very nauseous. I smoked a bit of weed to help the nausea, which intensified the tripping slightly as a side-effect. The three of us ended up in a big pile together on the sofa; although nauseous, I was still feeling very happy and close to my friends. t +6h00m My two friends decided to head back to LSD man’s house, but I was feeling too sick to go. I stay with another friend, and we watch TV. I began to feel very delirious, and out of it. My short term memory wasn't very functional; I was having trouble remembering what I was doing, the day etc. I found it very hard to carry on conversation with my friend, as I would just forget what I was saying in the middle of talking. I also noticed that my body was feeling very heavy, and movement was difficult. t +7h00m I began forgetting everything much more intensely, my friend's name, my own, where I was etc. Began to go through minor ego death, but mentally, not visually. t +8h00m Attempted sleep. Failure. t +9h00m My friend who had been on holiday arrived back, at five in the morning. I got up and chat to him, as I was still buzzing hard, and at this point was starting to trip slightly more. I started getting CEVs, which prevent me from sleeping. The visuals were similar to LSD visuals, but slightly duller color-wise. t +10h30m I attempted to sleep again, failure once again. I couldn’t shut my eyes properly, as they were still jittery. t +16h00m I finally got around an hours sleep. t +17h00m I began to feel slightly more normal again, but the comedown was pretty bad. I spent the rest of the day feeling down, with a bad headache, as well as being very tired.

Experience:30mg - Horrible bodyload,"I tried AMT for the first time relatively recently: set and setting was good, vitamins/nutrients taken to avoid potential problems, plenty of water and a little food before consumption, and dosage was within the lower band of 'moderate' on Erowid. The problem was that the trip had some very unpleasant physical side-effects, namely, what I can only describe as an intensely heavy body-load. I thought that this would pass after coming-up but it didn't. These symptoms first manifested themselves in very troubled bowels and a need to go to the toilet every 30-60 minutes, and as the trip continued, a seemingly complete inability for my body to control it's temperature - switching from shivering cold to the sweats within minutes. Mentally it was as I expected the trip to be, with the usual visual and light effects and distortions which at times were very pleasant. However, the body effects were so overwhelmingly dire that it seemed to take away any pleasure or insight I could gain from the drug. My friends also suffered from some very negative bodily effects so I am presuming that it isn't merely a bad individual reaction Submitted by - Anonymous Disregardeverythingisay reader","['diarrhea', 'drifting', 'frequent urination', 'geometry', 'spontaneous tactile sensations', 'temperature regulation suppression']",246
Experience:12 mg AMT - Nicely Surprised,"The only interesting visual I noticed was that it felt like i was watching a film through my eyes and sometimes i could even see that the frame-rate slowed, this is similar to many (triple mono-amine agonists) stimulants for me. Cannabis was smoked throughout the trip, shared so not a heavy sesh. This really reduced the nausea to a very bearable level which then subsided completely after and hour. 4 beers were also consumed, over the duration, this did not help nausea. The onset began almost two hours after swallowing the gelcap on a fairly empty stomach. Smooth and sweet come-up which lasted a good two hours, on a bus en-route to the party. The effects (dopaminergic waves rushing down spine and peripheral nerves) came in waves which then subsided and then peaked, each peak was slightly different in effect than the last. I noticed mydrasis, visuals and temperature fluctuations before any bodyload or other effects, i noticed this because car headlights appeared to me as if i could see every strand of light, each photon in a plethora of colors and the lamp nearby was mesmerising and entrancing. After 8 hours some stimulation remained but combined with exhaustion created the feeling of malaise. 2.5mg etizolam was consumed to promote sleep. After effects: very tired head and slight emotional exhaustion (similar to past psychedelic experiences despite this not being one). Mild hangover/depressive comedown lasted until evening of next day; physical tiredness. Summary: I have found this dose to be worthy of a night out, similar to a small/medium dose of a (triple mono-amine agonist) stimulant; 8 hours of dopaminergic and serotonergic agonism, which goes well with a beer and a party, slight head-fuck trip and gentle body high. But that's just my experience. Never done a bigger dose, initially started at 8.5mg then to 10mg, then to 12mg then 15mg (on different occasions). All at parties/clubs and this was the most worthy. Slight but bearable hangover. Rating: I really enjoyed this despite the setting being a warehouse party with a lot of unknown people there and etc. but was with a great group of friends.

Experience:6g mimosa / 2.5 g syrian rue - Best cake I've had for a while,"2.5g of syrian rue with 6g of mimosa hostilis root bark, ingested via Ayahuasca Cupcakes. Yup, just 6 grams. In a chocolate cake. ""They were triangle-based geometric patterns, laced over huge structures"" Initially I was nauseous, but the visuals built up and distracted me. They were triangle-based geometric patterns, laced over huge structures: first the triangular wallpaper was emanating from my centre of focus, then I started flying across the top of the surface, like it was a beautiful racecourse. I felt that as long as I stayed roughly in the centre then I would synch up with Josikins, who also had taken the same amount. Nausea came and went, and when it went the visuals lit up with glorious intensity – tinted orange like sunlight. I even felt warmer. Ayahuasca started to tell me how to better myself quite early on; first off I was told to get a hair cut (I've recently started a new job and have unkempt, shaggy, longish hair), to look more respectable, and to not be so bloody obvious about what I get up to after work (namely, all these drugs). At this point, I decided not to waste the trip by trying to understand what I saw as I saw it; I would just enjoy the ride and save my questions for afterwards – and this attitude made the trip so incredibly fucking fantastic. I got up and listened to the music we had on. It was Taxim by Kaleidoscope (the US band); a very ‘eastern’ sounding song. I already liked the music, but the patterns were following the song, playing out a video for me made of abstract visuals and color, and it felt like my mind had unlocked a gate leading to a new realm of music appreciation (in that I would appreciate even more eastern-influenced music). We went for a walk outside; me, Josikins, and our better halves (who were guiding us). Initially, the chilly air and concrete buildings, the pedestrians talking too loudly for my liking, made me think it was a mistake and I wanted to go back, but my girlfriend assured me that everything was fine so we carried on. I saw more people, who to me looked very aggressive, I saw dog shit on the pavement, and the journey, I knew, was quite a tough walk even sober, so I was very nervous. ""we could see the two big hills of Hastings overlooking the sea, and it was absolutely stunning"" We eventually took a short-cut through a public garden, and I was suddenly in awe at the beauty of the trees, the colors of the flowers, and I was grinning madly then on. The plants smelt amazing. We got to the top of the hill (past the playground, past rowdy teenagers who didn't even annoy me, as I knew they were just trying to have some fun), and we could see the two big hills of Hastings overlooking the sea, and it was absolutely stunning. I was totally relaxed, we put on some music, sat down, and I started going through Egodeath, though I was fully aware of it and functioned normally. I heard my own voice talking to me excitedly, and these sentences kept repeating themselves in my mind, overlapping each other, swirling around: “Don’t you see? The Hindus were right all along! They found this state-of-mind thousands of years ago!” “We are one” “I am God, they (my friends) are God, we are all God” “This is the reason we do anything” – ‘this’ being Egodeath/Bliss/Nirvana, and ‘anything’ meaning going to work, getting stressed, paying bills, etc. and “You have reached the absolute pinnacle of existence” – this last sentence kept sounding like it had voice-modulation, the end slowing down but remaining in the same pitch = “pinna-cle of exis-tence..” I came to the conclusion that, although it felt like I could access the history and future of the universe all at once, it didn’t really matter and all that matters is love; it binds us together, gives life its meaning, and is the very reason for existence. All other concerns came after, which is why I wasn’t all that fussed with trying to uncover impossible facts about the nature of the universe while going through Egodeath: it didn’t really matter. After all, what could I change? So I focused on the idea of love, and tripped absolute balls in bliss. We walked on again and watched the sunset. We then went back to the house, and after the chilly walk the warmth of the room was very welcome. I sat down and went through Egodeath again, all the while the phrases were repeating. Though this time my mind was very clear, there weren’t any visuals (just a clear white light), and I let my breathing slow down and eventually stop; I wasn’t holding my breath, I just didn’t need to breathe any more. While I was like this I felt like I was floating slightly off of my chair, suspended in zero gravity. It was an incredibly liberating sensation. Every so often, I breathed normally and looked around, admiring the good company and nice, safe surroundings. I looked at the people in the room one by one, and my voice in my head said things about them. To one guy who wasn’t tripping, it said “trust in him, he’s in your inner circle as well”, to Josikins it said “you owe this man a lot, treat him well”, and to my girlfriend it said “she will be with you forever, love her forever”. Then I’d close my eyes and float again. I gently cried tears of joy, as the love I felt was just so great. My girlfriend drove us home, and I was giddy with excitement; any moment now, I was going to transcend! There were no cars on the road, because there were only a few people in existence right now! Though actually I was just coming down and had thought loops, so I thought I was going to go through Egodeath again. I ended the trip being utterly dopey; I went to the bathroom, forgot why I was there, and just stood around for ages. I thought I had done something terrible and felt really guilty. I didn’t sleep as I felt so guilty and needed to piss so badly because I forgot to go while in the bathroom, but I didn’t do anything about it as I thought it was an adequate punishment for some horrible thing I had done. There wasn’t anything I did, of course, I just needed guidance on everything at that point, and I needed help getting undressed and put into bed... But hey, what a trip!

Experience:3.5g Syrian rue + 10g Mimosa Hostilis,"Effects were felt quite fast. After about an hour my girlfriend came home and noticed that i had taken ayahuasca. She was not very happy with that, but it was kind of ok. That was not a problem for me because i knew that before and was comfortable with that. But things got shitty. I had to go to the toilet but when i wanted to put my trousers back on i realized i was a little dizzy. At that point my view was partly disturbed. I did not notice hallucinations like patterns, but i could not really see that much. At the same time i was nearly unable to articulate full sentences. Then my girlfriend opened the door to the toilet and saw me sitting on the ground trying to put my sweat pants back on. That must've been a weird picture. She instantly enraged and was short before calling ambulance or my mom. I could understand everything she said, but i was not able to tell her that everything is ok. I was in full consciousness. That was already a bad experience. But things got worst. We both sat down on the table and she told me that i had overdone it now and she is going to leave me. These word triggered a feeling for me that i would expect others to describe it as the fear of death. I had a feeling that the world will now collapse. It was not to describe with words. What was on my mind at that time was a little more weird. I heard voices that told me that i had openend pandoras box and dismantled the simulated world. I heard voices from several people (i had a feeling that these voices are part of my family). They told me that they gave me enough signs to not evaluate the simulation theory via ayahuasca. They seemed to be frightened of me exposing/getting knowledge of the truth. I think that these voices were simply my own thoughts of the past. They matched the theories i made up in mind. And somehow Aya made me think this is the reality. I may have been in ego death state so that i could not distinguish where the voices really came from. That could be the reason why i thought these voices were my family, there were simply myself. And i believed what they said because somehow everything makes sense under the influence of DMT. This really powerful feeling lasted some time (dunno how long really) until i told my girlfriend to never do something like that again. I might have done anything to calm her down and stay with me. I gave her the rest of my MHRB and she poored it down the toilet. After that she could calm down and so could i too.","['delusion', 'ego death', 'language suppression', 'spontaneous tactile sensations', 'suggestibility enhancement', 'time distortion']",539
Experience:3.5g Syrian rue + 50g Mimosa Hostilis - I was trying to engage in sexual intercourse with the personification of Ayahuasca,"Full-on hallucinations on Ayahuasca I was the last of a group of us to come up (as usual), but I started tripping when I saw fibres of light on everything. I laid down and covered my eyes with my jumper. The first hallucination. I was trying to engage in sexual intercourse with the personification of Ayahuasca, which was a large 3D cylinder made entirely of visuals, with a few arm-like protrusions at random points. Ayahuasca was having none of it, and I didn’t want to force myself upon her and end the trip early or shame myself, so I ceased. I opened my eyes, looked around the room, and went back under the jumper. The second hallucination. ""So you’re a dude! Sorry about earlier, I always thought of you as a sexy female temptress"" I was looking into the dirty, messy living room of a house I had never seen before, and saw an overweight humanoid in a baseball cap and ill-fitting t-shirt watching TV on an armchair. This was another personification of Ayahuasca, but this one was male. Everything in this hallucination was made of different shades of blue, including Ayahuasca. I realised this was Ayahuasca, “So you’re a dude! Sorry about earlier, I always thought of you as a sexy female temptress” I thought/said. He seemed cool about the whole mix-up. It turned out he was an overweight teenager, and was a massive stoner. He proceeded to take my hand and show me where he lived, so we flew in the sky like Superman above his house. The house was atop a huge cliff that was perfectly smooth and semi-circular. Beneath the front garden was a sheer drop thousands of miles deep, which looked like an endless abyss. Ayahuasca told me he likes to trip and stare into the abyss to see the visuals. The third hallucination, including the build-up. For some reason the stoner Ayahuasca hallucination stopped, so I went upstairs where my friend Josikins tested her strobe light on me; eyes closed but with my face close to the strobe light, for a few flashes there were geometric, wire-y visuals, but they ended quickly and it was just a strobe light again. We went into the bathroom together, as it had no windows and was the darkest room in the house, kept the lights off and chatted for a bit. I told her about my hallucination, and she was telling me something (but I can’t remember what), and then left. Only a few seconds passed with me in total darkness and utter silence, but I started hearing music (it sounded very similar to the first 45 seconds of ‘No Quarter’ by Led Zeppelin), and I was lifted out of my body – utterly DMT-like! This hallucination, however brief, was the most vivid and real one I have ever experienced (and I was once convinced that I was a medical book with a few pages missing when I had a fever once). The content wasn’t constructed out of visuals, everything looked perfectly real. I was in the sky, among the clouds, jumping fantastically high and for long distances, using rogue clouds as stepping stones. In the distance was an enormous castle which looked very similar in structure to the one you see in the beginning of Disney credits, only this one was made of crystal and was refracting/deflecting light like a prism, which covered the castle in a flowing rainbow. It was beautiful. I jumped over a few more clouds, trying to make it to the castle, but missed one and fell. I was among lower clouds, covering the sky like a blanket, and I was slowly sinking beneath them. I had one hand outstretched, trying to reach the castle, and I saw dozens of other hands doing the same thing around me. I was eventually submerged beneath the clouds, and that was me back in the bathroom in the dark, smiling insanely. I heard the pipes groaning and somehow knew that that was my last hallucination of the evening, so went downstairs and joined the others. That was, effectively, the end of my trip (just the fibre of light overlaying everything was left).

Experience:3.5g Syrian rue + 30g Mimosa Hostilis brew - flying through a rainbow tunnel,"First Ayahuasca experience / first proper psychedelic experience 30g, drank The first thing I noticed was the feeling of my hands melting into my thighs as I was sitting. Then a few minutes later I saw my friend’s face go ‘glitchy’, and his nose stretched and went back to normal. That all happened in a matter of seconds, and I knew I had started tripping. I closed my eyes and saw my first psychedelic visuals; geometric, brilliantly colored fractals and wire-y shapes morphing in front of me. I looked at my friend’s PC screen when he was changing the song, and saw inside the monitor; though the front was flat and I knew how thin the monitor was, I could see deep inside the screen, which looked like a very small room defined by a matrix of fantastic colors. I shut my eyes again and just followed the light show in front of me. Eventually I saw some sci-fi engine which, I guessed, was the particle accelerator of the universe’s engine. Or whatever. My friends and I took some Nitrous Oxide via balloons, and this set me off down a tunnel of rainbow colors (much like the DMT seal image found on disregardeverythingisay.com), accompanied by a high-pitched, generic sci-fi sounding noise (like a digital home telephone ringing constantly, but the pitch shift was linked to the speed I was going). I got very close to the end of the tunnel, but started to slow down and was exiting the tunnel, backwards. We took some more nitrous whilst standing up, and I noticed the tunnel’s shape had changed from just a circle to a symmetrical outline of a lady (like the ones you see on truckers’ mudflaps), again accompanied by the high pitched noise. I didn’t make it through again, but I noticed that if I squeezed the empty balloon in my hand, whenever air came out of the balloon I would briefly accelerate again. Of course, I was slowing down overall, so it didn’t get me to the end, but it was strange how squeezing this empty balloon was affecting my trip so obviously. From then on it was generic visuals until sobriety.

Experience:3g Syrian Rue + 5g Acacia Confusa - Life Changing Madness,"First, some important background information. I had only started smoking cannabis 3-4 months before this experience. My cannabis use was uncontrolled and was a minor problem. My heavy use was ended when the police searched my dorm room. I have been diagnosed with ADHD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The cannabis certainly helped with the anxiety, but having to stop for drug tests and getting in trouble with the law and the school really did not help. I had been interested in psychedelics prior to this event and had tried 25b once before. I also took LSD twice and then mushrooms once before this Ayahuasca experience. I had a friend at this time (B) that had separation anxiety and addiction issues. He could not stand to be alone for one second. He demanded that I brought him along and made a separate dose for him. Not wanting to hurt his feelings, I agreed to do this. I had hoped that it would help open his eyes. He did not care what the effects of the drug were, he just wanted to get high. When I had a free couple of days, I decided to do it, thinking I had researched enough and was prepared. When the brew was prepared, my friend and I met at a set of tables spaced appropriately from any buildings so smokers could sit and smoke. These tables were fairly popular among many drug users as a hangout spot. I decided to make the Ayahuasca Milkshake. We ate the seeds, then 15-25 minutes later, we began drinking the milkshake. The taste and smell was horrendous. It was quite difficult to get down. I believe if i had put more bananas in it that it would have been somewhat easier. When we were done we just sat around. A crowd started accumulating; it's easy to get people out there just by sitting there. My set and setting were both bad. I was worried about the legal issues, annoyed that my ""friend"" was there. There was someone there who was not a drug user and just wanted to see something bad happen to us. He continuously made non-helpful remarks like ""Oh I'm having so much fun"" and then pretending to vomit. Eventually I began to feel a little light headed and extremely nauseous. It was difficult to process what was going on in my field of vision, fairly intensely decreased Visual Acuity and Visual Haze. I felt like I was only half-conscious: maybe this could be categorized as Thought Deceleration. I sat down for a few seconds and, in attempt to seem like I was okay, asked some people what they were doing. As soon as the question left my mouth, A wave of blackness overcame me (Consciousness disconnection?). It was as if I blinked and let my muscles relax, no convulsions. As soon as I opened my eyes again, everyone was looking at me. Some said I just had a seizure. The one who was not a drug user but was probably the most intelligent and most medically knowledgeable said that it was not. I don't believe it was a seizure, just the power of the brew kicking in rapidly (Loss of Motor Control). I needed to lay down. Another friend said that I could rest in his room. I began to walk with him towards his dorm, but soon after standing up, another wave of darkness hit me. Whatever my eyes were focused on I could see just fine, but around the edges of my vision were kaleidoscoping black triangles. I had no sense of what was going on, but people we're holding me up, guiding me to my friend's room. I was not thinking anything. It was very dreamlike. I thought that, when I lost muscle control, I had soiled myself. When I got into the elevator, there was a sorority girl in there. She looked at me and said something about drinking, to which my fellow table-goers agreed was the problem (although they knew it was not). I decided that it would be a good idea to tell her that I thought I soiled myself. I blanked out again and found myself on the bed when I opened my eyes again. I needed to check if I was correct about the bladder problem, so I asked for help getting to the bathroom. It turns out that I had not, but when I got out of the stall, I found I could walk around again just fine. If I had been capable of any thought at that time, I would have known I was dying. B was still sitting outside at the table, just staring off into space. After resting on the bed for a bit, just feeling embarrassed and lightheaded but not really tripping, I decided I would get out of my friend's hair and go lay in MY bed. Everyone was still concerned I would have another ""Seizure"" but I did not. I also could not throw up, although I wanted to. When I was alone in my room, laying down, I began to feel myself slipping off into something like non-existence. I think what I was experiencing was what dying feels like. It was almost physical. The shadows of the blinds on the ceiling seemed to go on forever. My thought patterns were looping very badly but I was slowly gaining more introspective insight. I also felt a very vague presence but I could not put my finger on it nor was there any kind of communication. After a while of this, the friend who let me lay in his room called me and told me that B made him call 911. This kicked my anxiety into overdrive, although that situation would probably do that to anyone. I immediately jumped out of bed, grabbed the ingredients for the brew and went to another dorm to throw them away in a trash chute. I found that suddenly I had thought acceleration instead of deceleration. I speed walked down to the table to try to locate B's room mate to tell him what happened and to suggest that he relocate his cannabis supplies. Then I went back to my room. On the way there I noticed that for quite some time I had been hearing a quiet screeching/buzzing/humming noise. Like a white noise made of screams. I was still nauseous but could not throw up. I just laid in my room waiting for it to end, waiting to fall asleep, feeling sure I was dying. When it was over I began to deeply question the nature of reality. Somewhere, maybe when I felt the other's presence, I felt another reality, so alien and unlike ours. I was scared to close my eyes because I thought that when I opened them I might find myself in another reality. I have developed an intense fear of my inevitable death. I also occasionally get mild dissociation. These effects are almost gone, 3 months later, although I doubt I can ever truly come to terms with my death (and I think most people can not). However, I became very motivated to do well in all areas of life. I am far more understanding of other people than I was. Far more open-minded, capable of seeing things from other's perspectives. I don't think the life-changing came from the feeling that I was dying but it was part of it. Some day I will try again in a good set and setting.

Experience:3g mimosa / 3g syrian rue - Connecting with my body,"I began my trip in my bedroom with my significant other who was just coming down from their ayahuasca trip about to go to sleep. This was the first time trying the new chocolate intense recipe. I had just finished chomping down my syrian rue chocolate bar that didn't taste fantastic, but the ginger made the taste of syrian rue slightly more bearable. I then waited about an hour or so before munching on my chocolate rootbark cupcakes. I then decided to lay in bed and watched some tv show on Netflix and after about half an hour or so I became unbelievably tired and turned it off, I looked at the clock, and it was 12 o clock, I went to sleep, and I thought to myself while drifting off 'oh well at least I tried' or so I thought. At 2 am I was suddenly forced awake to my field of vision being completely overtaken by intense visual geometry that ranged from fast and slow moving and brightly colored visuals. I lied there in bed for what felt like about 5 minutes mesmerized by these visuals and suddenly I had a strong feeling that one of the residents at the care home I work for was walking slowly with her zimmer frame next to my bed, this lady usually walks around the care home just fine without any assistance but occasionally she'll try to help us out and collect tea cups while still holding her frame, it's not a huge deal because she's not necessarily putting herself at risk because she can actually walk without her frame but it makes it harder for her to use her frame properly while holding loads of cups, plus she could drop them. So I was laying there and felt that she was in my presence, I couldn't see or hear her but really believed she was right next to me, my first thought was ""she'll be alright she's usually fine and isn't holding them for very long as the kitchen is right next to the lounge, I'll just carry on looking at these beautiful visuals"" The visuals started to become a little dull and less vibrant and not so exciting anymore but were still interesting to watch, but at this point I thought that the ayahuasca was giving me a test. I had two options, help out an old lady so that she remains safe, or carry on watching these visuals. It didn't take very long for me to decide that helping out my fellow man (or in this case woman) was more important than paying attention to some visual geometry. So I sat up at the edge of my bed and the hallucination suddenly disappeared. I was a little stumped and didn't know what to do so I lied back down in bed but decided I wanted to go outside and explore. I turned the lamp on, and I was suddenly flooded with excitement I had accelerated thoughts, visual acuity enhancement, enhancement of colors. Time felt like it had sped up and that I was doing everything in fast motion.

Experience:3g mimosa / 2g syrian rue - I was the Universe's prophet,"2g syrian rue, 3g mimosa hostilis root bark. Method of ingestion: banana smoothie (2 bananas, quarter pint of milk, one teaspoon of honey) I was nauseous for the start of the trip, and the closed-eye-visuals looked like the inside of my brain, but black. I purged and thought that I’d be ill for the rest of the trip, but Ayahuasca reassured me, said that this kind of thing happens sometimes, etc. I felt my temperature rise, and felt every pore in my body secrete sweat, and it was pretty interesting feeling my bodily functions so sensitively. I also caught glimpses of myself in the mirror (which I know you shouldn’t do for fear of bad vibes) and I looked like utter shit, but hey. I went back into my bedroom, turned on a fan (it was hot), and sat on the bed. Instantly Ayahuasca made me sit up straighter, and my CEVs instantly sparked up and became mesmerising. From then on the trip was incredible. Purging made me think of a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis; I had got rid of the superfluous stuff filling my body, and now my mind could explore the wilderness freely. I began to look at my hands and started to contemplate evolution; humans have become the perfect vessel to explore inner and outer space. We have out ape heritage on display (body hair, etc) and should be proud of where we came from, but our minds have developed to a point that our imaginations fuel our progress. I thought that was cool. My poster fell off the wall, so I put it back up, and I appreciated the complexity of the process that comes so easily; with my ape hands I dextrously handled the delicate paper, used enough strength to make it stick to the wall, had to take into account the force of gravity acting against it, and I was absent mindedly using trigonometry to get the angle aesthetically correct in relation to the wall and ceiling; maths, physics and kinetics are all being exercised just by doing something as mundane as putting up a poster. Sound was altered that day, and everything sounded like it had a machine-like phaser effect. The hum of my fan throbbed and changed pitch, so it made the noise seem more natural than it really was. I was again looking at my hands, flexing my fingers, making fists, and marvelling at my new-found dexterity. My hands were sweating, but that was a good thing, like it was lubricant for a complex machine. I stretched my toes, wiggled them individually (which I can’t normally do), and imagined being a lion lounging in the sun, stretching every muscle. I could even flex muscles individually, so I could focus on one muscle in my thigh and flex it. I really enjoyed being in command of my body like that. When I was smoking a joint I was nimbly playing with it, rolling it between my fingers with confidence. I felt more primal in this state, as I’m not normally as confident in what I can do with my body. My hair felt incredible; it felt super-clean and fuller than normal, flopping over my face playfully. I felt I understood hippies’ aversions to products and to cutting hair, because at moments like that it feels so good and natural. I thought about the universe and started to form pseudo-religion ideas about it. I imagined it to be the creator of all things, as it is everything; space, time, and matter. In order for it to reproduce asexually it creates galaxies, solar systems, planets and life. Eventually some of that life will evolve intelligence, and some of that intelligence will evolve into pure thought, to such a point where they will be able to create universes. The penalty for the original universe’s reproduction is that it has to adhere to the linear march of time, marching onwards, because that’s the only way intelligence will evolve. Eventually time will kill the universe, as it kills all things. In the meantime, like every mother, its children (including us) will live on and reproduce, creating more universes. I felt as though I was being told all of this from the universe itself, as its own reward for this process is enjoying the diverse beauty of all of its creations; art, music, and the inhabitants of the planets themselves. Everything we are and what we make is a mark of evolutionary genius. The phrase ‘we are the masters of our own creation’ kept repeating itself, but I can’t fully remember the explanation. I was predicting man’s own transcendence into pure thought, so maybe that was a reference to the universe we will one day create. I felt a lot of love for my friends on my peak, so I sent a few texts asking how everyone is. I thought up a long thank you message for my mum to hear when she becomes pure thought after death. I thanked her for her selfless love, and for creating me. I thanked my dad for the same and for giving my passion, absolute passion, for music. For my girlfriend I was thankful for looking after me while I was going through physical and mental ecstasy, and for being there all the time. Everything I pondered came back to evolution. Everything we that we are has its own, self-repeating catalyst; there was once only one language, spoken by one group of early humans, and now there are hundreds, having been thousands, and they can understand each other. This was a metaphor for mankind, for intelligence. There will be a point, in the future, when all of the universe’s intelligent beings will understand each other. I thought about politics, and saw it as an evolutionary process. I thought of right-wing politics, trying to stem the tide of progress; as the world becomes more liberal we are marching onwards to greater ages of civil rights and more liberties, ultimately send out more love and good vibes. I went outside and looked at the sky, and I could see properly that it was a canvass of gas, of chemical processes. The clouds started to form a single, swirling visual, and it was like the end of the Adventure Time episode ‘All The Little People’, when Finn speaks to the mini-Finn and mini-Finn sees clouds forming a shape to speak to him. The cloud I saw was the universe’s face, which was complex, geometric visuals. I looked at the floor and the paving slabs turned into an Aztec rug, so I thought about the ‘primitive’ people who had access to these kinds of psychedelics, and felt that I understood why they didn’t have the technology the ‘West’ had when they were conquered; because they didn’t need it. To them they could access the realm of the divine, and what’s better than that? In all, I fully appreciate being what I am. As a human I have an incredibly adaptable body, carrying a complex brain capable of world-changing and life-altering ideas. I didn’t get a lot of sleep that night, as my thoughts were still running at full-speed, but I wasn’t tired when I went to work the next day feeling great. My life is affirmed, my place in life is sweet, and I’m fully content.

Experience:2.5g Syrian rue + 6g Mimosa Hostilis - Becoming God (my second experience with unity),"I took the syrian rue by powdering it in a mortar and pestle and washing it down with milk, before waiting approximately 45 minutes to drink down 7 grams of MHRB blended into a banana smoothie. I only managed to drink roughly 6 grams, however, as the sheer amount of liquid was difficult to take in. Though these were both unpleasant and nauseating to consume, it was nothing when compared to the foul-tasting, traditionally-brewed method which I am extremely familiar with. I was tripping within the presence of DemFractalsYo who was also taking ayahuasca, but through the Ayahuasca cupcake method of preparation; she took 2g of syrian rue and roughly 2.5g of MHRB. After consuming our substances, we spent approximately one hour in a well-lit living room whilst waiting for the effects of the drug to show. The first set of effects I noticed were a distinct body high which felt like a warm soft bodily glow and a brightening of colours. This was accompanied by strong level 3 drifting within and across flat surfaces around the room such as the carpet, ceiling and walls. In terms of cognitive alterations, it was at this point that I started to feel anxious and paranoid over the thought that perhaps I should not have taken ayahuasca tonight as I felt the overwhelmingly negative vibe that ""something was not right"". I could not identify its source and simply decided that I should give my ayahuasca usage a break after this trip to collect my thoughts, as I realized that I had literally been taking it on a daily basis for what must have been weeks. This feeling of anxiety remained, however - even after I had reached this conclusion but I did not let it overwhelm me and it faded once I began to concentrate on other things. We decided that we were now tripping hard enough to leave the well lit living room and enter into a small, extremely dark room that we had previously prepared as an environment to enjoy the experience with maximum effects and minimal external influence. We entered the room and I began to feel that my subconscious was ""fucking with me"" or ""trolling me"" as if it was trying to teach me some sort of lesson, and it was resulting in strong feelings of anxiety. I expressed this to DemFractalsYo and after an extremely short period of discussion we were interrupted by a shelf collapsing behind us, creating a sudden loud noise and tipping miscellaneous objects all over us. This terrified me and created the strongest sensation that the universe was deliberately trolling me as some sort of test to evoke a response. At this point I was beginning to trip hard and was experiencing extremely defined level 4 visual geometry within the darkness of the room. These fast-moving sets of complex geometry could be described as completely typical and standard to that of the ayahuasca experience. They were structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, equal in blurred and sharp edges and equal in rounded and angular corners. They looked very natural, ancient and had mystical undertones in their perceived visual vibe. We felt that we must be close to hitting our peaks and began to smoke marijuana to intensify the experience. After a vague period of time, my roommate knocked on the door and informed me that a close friend was in the living room and that it was his birthday. We were tripping hard but decided to leave the safety of our small dark room and wish him happy birthday. Upon entering the living the room and wishing our friend happy birthday I noticed that the visual geometry became extremely frantic in its motions. The intricate patterns condensed into wires made of light which proceeded to rapidly flail about my visual field in random unpredictable directions. I sat down and realized that they were watching a military film which appeared to be set in a modern day Iraqi or Afghan war zone. Almost immediately I began to feel extremely anxious as the soldiers began shooting each other whilst the trip continued to intensify in its effects. This lead me to become extremely immersed within the violence and suffering. I was beginning to teeter on the brink of ego death and feared that I would lose control and attack my friends in the battle field despite the fact that I did not have a gun. Moments later I progressed ever deeper into the ego death and lost my sense of self momentarily. I then started to feel that I was the universe searching for itself within itself but had entirely forgotten that it was itself. At this point a brief moment of realization hit me, I realized that I had found myself and that it had been right in front of me all along. The real me was revealed as not something which resides inside the skin but everything around me with which I connect. There was not a single coherent linguistic thought within my internal narrative but through feeling alone I knew what was happening. I had once again began to enter a state of unity and interconnectedness but as I realized this my attention was drawn back to the terrifying sounds of guns and death. I decided that perhaps this was not the most appropriate environment to be tripping on a psychedelic, I grabbed the spliff which I had given to my room-mate, and hurried back to the safety of our private trip room with my friend and my dog who had decided to follow us. Upon entering the room I sat down and commented on how genuinely frightened the film had made me before instantly beginning to slip straight back into ego death once more. It was at this point which I became completely silent and unresponsive. ""Are you ok?"" ""Are you sure?"" ""What's happening?"" ""Can you talk?"" ""Is everything alright?"" I heard these phrases and understood them but could only nod or shake my head in response. I was completely unsure of what was happening and found myself stuck in a thought loop in which I repeatedly performed reality checks to ensure that I was not dreaming. I started to feel that everything around me had been taken to it's most extreme of options. I looked at my dog and assumed that it was going to attack me, I turned the light off and assumed that something evil was now lurking within the darkness, I heard my friends within the living room and assumed they were going to drag me out and force me to become responsive. I then looked at the darkened silhouette of my friend and assumed that she was forcefully trying to have sex with me. I was too immobile to respond to any of these threats but saw my friend lit up, floating around the room comprised entirely of condensed visual geometry while she audibly stated ""it's ok josikins, nobody would know!"". This continued until my girlfriend unexpectedly entered the room after arriving home from work and the moment I saw her I assumed that she too was about to forcefully have sex with me. I continued to lay there in the darkness, I was extremely disorientated but after a vague period of time I slipped out of these continuous delusions and although I could not talk, a sense of clarity began to wash over me. I realized that my sense of self, I or me had become attributed to all of existence. I felt once again that I was not just a separate skin-encapsulated being trapped within a physical body but, an organism which was one with this entire universe. I felt this so strongly and saw that the room around me was as much a part of myself as any other. I felt that this room and this body was deeply interconnected and dependent upon the entire universe which resided within and around it and that every last atom of it was all me. I looked at my watch and felt that I had somehow stepped out of the illusion of relative time and that I could access all times from the creation of the universe to its destruction and dissipation. It was revealed to me that everything which had ever happened or will ever happen across the entirety of this reality's timeline were all ""me"" and that I had existed for an eternity. The ayahuasca showed me that human beings were trapped in an illusion of perspective which made it seem as if only the present physically existed. In actuality however, it was stated that all events past, present and future exist together and are continuously occurring within their individual time frames simultaneously. This realization that I was not only all of physical existence within the present moment but all of existence across all time frames resulted in some immediate and profound subconscious extrapolations of perspective. I suddenly felt that I had existed since the beginning of time, long before this particular part of me had come into play a mere 20 years ago. I felt that I was the supreme thinker behind all actions which had ever occurred but that I had forgotten this due to the nature of this part of my self's particular human form. It became somehow clear to me that I had created this entire universe perfectly and consciously down to the tiniest detail. My entire life was felt to have been planned out in advance by this supreme self which was me and so had everybody else's. I understood that my true self outside of this insignificant body contained all of existence. I was therefore all knowing, all powerful, resided everywhere and had created everything. The moment I felt this it all clicked together. I was and always had been the very definition of god itself in every sense of the word. We were all god and the basis for such a concept in a scientific, logical universe finally became clear to me. I felt that I had stumbled upon the answer to our existence and became overwhelmed with profound religious ecstasy. This feeling was paralyzing and stayed with me for an extended period of time. I sat there in disbelief trying to comprehend the full gravity of this new ayahuasca induced perspective. The music played and I ignored it up until the moment that an extremely relevant song began to play. We were listening to a band known as Shpongle[1], it was a long, drawn out instrumental introduction but I knew what was coming. The beat kicked in and the female vocalist began to sing the chorus, ""You are me and I am you. I'll always be with you."" ""You are me and I am you. I'll always be with you."" ""You are the sun, the rain, and the moon beams. You are the Divine Goddess of my dreams."" ""You are the sun, the rainbows, the moon beams. You are the Divine Goddess inside me"" It was too much. I understood these lyrics on a level which I had never previously felt and instantly began to break down into tears of sheer profundity. I cried continuously as I weeped for everything that had ever or would ever exist. I understood just how perfect this world really was and continued to breakdown as I came to terms with my new reality and the true nature of existence. Throughout this my friend watched over me and reassured me that everything was ok. On occasion I would stop crying for just a moment, temporarily regain the ability to speak in a perfectly sober manner and ask the question ""could you please roll another spliff?"" before immediately regressing back into the emotional breakdown. This was a religious experience in every sense of the word and I felt clearly that it was the most profound moment of my entire life. Despite all of this however, I still held a strong desire to keep smoking marijuana spliffs throughout it. After a vague period of time I stopped crying and began to explain the situation to my friend. I thanked her for watching over me and understood clearly what an extremely important person she would always be in my life. The feelings of unity subsided and I was no longer everything but completely psychologically exhausted. I hugged my friend goodbye and collapsed in bed as I had work the next morning and needed to be up for 7am. In the morning I woke up feeling absolutely refreshed and ready to face the day despite the fact that I had only slept for roughly 3 - 4 hours. Over the following weeks I noticed that this trip had inflicted lasting changes to my perspective of the world. I could no longer look at my life and the things within it without getting the strongest physical sensation that ""I designed it this way myself"". Even weeks after the experience had ended, I was walking my dog through a local park and came across a tree. I began to breakdown and became overwhelmed once again with the feeling that my true self had designed it this way and marveled at the profound complexity of its composition. This new perspective lasted for roughly 3 weeks but eventually faded into an idea which was only intellectually understood but no longer physically or emotionally felt. All in all this experience was the most profound that I have ever been through. I cannot over exaggerate just how life changing it really was and simply recollecting it in such a high level of detail for the purposes of documentation resulted in the shedding of tears at multiple points throughout the writing process.

Experience:2.5g Syrian rue + 6g Mimosa Hostilis - My first experience with unity,"I took the syrian rue by powdering it in a mortar and pestle and washing it down with milk, before waiting approximately 45 minutes to drink down 7 grams of MHRB blended into a banana smoothie. I only managed to drink roughly 6 grams, however, as the sheer amount of liquid was difficult to take in. Though these were both unpleasant and nauseating to consume, it was nothing when compared to the foul-tasting, traditionally-brewed method which I am extremely familiar with. I was tripping within the presence of 2 friends who were also taking ayahuasca through the same method of preparation; one of them took the full 7g and the other 2.5g of MHRB. After consuming the milkshakes, we spent approximately one hour in a well-lit living room, smoking marijuana and waiting for the effects of the drug to show before heading into a small, extremely dark room that we had previously prepared as an environment to enjoy the experience with maximum effects and minimal external influence. At the start of the trip I simply sat there in darkness, listening to an album which I had not heard before that my friend was playing throughout the trip by a psytrance artist known as Tipper[1], whilst sharing marijuana-filled spliffs between my two friends as we engaged in typical stoner talk and psychedelic conversation. Shortly after I entered the darkened room I began to notice a distinct but mild body high and defined level 4 visual geometry. The fast-moving sets of complex geometry were structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, equal in blurred and sharp edges and equal in rounded and angular corners. They looked very natural, ancient and had mystical undertones in their perceived visual vibe. As I began to progressively come up, I became more and more unresponsive in my ability to communicate and became reserved to total silence, despite the fact that I could still understand what my friends were discussing and listened intently throughout a huge portion of the trip. It was at this point that I began to break through into a visual space of profoundly complex level 6 geometry. I felt perfectly calm and extremely mindful as I saw all of those who are close to me laid out in front of my eyes. They appeared in the form of detailed visual representations, comprised of condensed psychedelic geometry. As this happened I began to evaluate them one by one as a voice within my head provided me with a detailed verbal analysis of how lucky I am to have such people in my life, while providing loving advice and information on their relationship to my existence and the need for me to care for them as much as they demonstrate that they care for me. After this I have large periods of amnesia as the visuals further increased in their intensity until at some unknown point in the evening I passed through the geometry and onto the other side. I then found myself in a state which I immediately recognised although had never previously experienced but knew that it was referred to by my own system as a level 4 State of unity and interconnectedness. At first I simply noticed that the geometry had died down in its intensity from level 6 to level 4 and had been replaced by an overwhelmingly complex and seemingly life-changing perspective switch that could not be described as anything short of a substance-induced religious experience. I couldn't quite comprehend the true nature of what was happening but immediately felt profoundly calm and mindful in my thought processes towards it, understanding innately that I should not give in to astonishment as this is something that I often find myself becoming overwhelmed with in similar situations. I knew that if I did this I would slip into an all-too familiar state of ecstatic religious delusion and fool myself into thinking that I had not only figured out the key to humanity's transcension but that I now understand it well enough to immediately implement on a global scale ""just as soon as I sober up"". Once this cleared up and I realized that I was not going to be overwhelmed with astonishment I began to slowly piece together what exactly it was that I was feeling. At first all I knew was that I had the overwhelming sense that this was somehow a ""religious experience"" although I had very little coherent sentences within my thoughts. As time went on however I slowly realized that my usually familiar and well-defined concept of ""I"", ""self"", or ""me"" was no longer attributed to a separate ego and it's internal thought stream as it is throughout normal sober living. Instead, it had become attributed to my internally stored model of reality in its entirety and therefore all of space and time. ""I"" suddenly saw with such clarity the interdependent connections between all things and realized that ""I"" was and always have been the entire universe experiencing itself through the specific point in space and time which my ego happens to reside in. It felt that ""I"" had simply forgotten this due to the inherent nature of the human form that this part of me had manifested itself into and the way in which my perspective has been drastically shaped by the surrounding society. The concept of a culturally ingrained and vaguely defined sense of self-hood that ""I"" had been raised into believing was revealed to be nothing more than an illusory symbol or approximation of words. ""I"" felt that in actuality ""I"" was not a central separate agent confronting an external world which was not ""me"", but that it was all the universe experiencing itself. ""I"" felt and understood that the observer and the observed were a unified system of behaviour, in which the concept of a separate self made no physical sense whatsoever beyond symbolic and illusory thought. In simpler terms, the true self beyond everyday illusion was revealed as something not confined to its ego and the image it has created of itself through interactions with other people, but the entire universe as a whole. The sentences ""We are all it"" and ""I designed it this way myself"" looped through my thought stream over and over again. It was revealed to me through an innate revelation that the reason I am living this life, with this extremely specific geographic location, friends, loved ones, life and plot is not because of sheer chance or coincidence as I had previously thought but because I had designed it all this way myself. I had always existed throughout all times, I had created the universe which was myself and everything within it from the very beginning, nothing was left to simple chance and every aspect of this cosmic plot had been carefully planned out in advanced by the very thing which it was. In a single moment I realized and felt with a huge sense of genuine emotion that every last one of my personal insecurities which comprised my particular retarded tragic back story was a deliberate and important plot element which a great attractor was pulling the stuff of this reality into. It somehow became clear that although my ego associated these things with negative attachments, they were simply contrast to states of positivity and therefore, at a higher level, could only be viewed as harmonious order within a greater system which I felt to be truly perfect in every single way. As this was happening I remained completely silent, occasionally sighing or quietly weeping tears of sheer joy into a blanket. Every now and then, however, I would regularly move to drink water and smoke more weed which my friends would periodically pass to me. When I moved to perform these actions they had a completely different feeling attributed to them in comparison to that of every day sober living in a way that was profound but extremely difficult to describe adequately. Instead of feeling that I was a central and separate ego rearranging the external environment around itself, I felt that the universe was simply a self-arranging autonomous process of continuously shifting energy transfers which comprised the greater whole with unified, interdependent sub-components that acted upon each other mutually. The bottle I was drinking from was just as much me as the person drinking it; it moved itself just as much as my body moved it, and my friends were simply manifestations of myself talking to itself. This perspective was overwhelming and sustained itself for what must have been at least an hour or two. I laid there completely unresponsive to my friends but listening to the music and conversation whilst visualizing, and feeling everything which they were saying with incredible detail through high levels of conceptual thinking. Eventually, however, I began to come down and regained my ability and desire to communicate. We went for a walk in a local park and I felt truly overwhelmed by the experience which I had just encountered as it seemed to not only be life changing in its consequences but possessed as of yet unrecognised historical significance. At this point it became clear to me that assuming this perspective contained even a shred of understandable and scientifically verifiable truth, that it was the single most important discovery which humanity had ever or will ever make. After two years of studying the concept of unity and discussing it with those who have experienced it for themselves I was finally here. I had never seen it coming and had often accepted that perhaps my detailed knowledge of this concept and strong desire for the specific experience itself was the very thing that would forever hold me back from it. Perhaps it was this acceptance that allowed me to experience it, but I also strongly suspect that ayahuasca can consistently induce this state more so than any other psychedelic.

Experience:2g Syrian rue + 1g Mimosa Hostilis - These voices are the building blocks of consciousness,"First-time Ayahuasca report, to whomever it may concern. There are a few things to be said before I get to the actual report. Firstly, I’m still very much a beginner when it comes to psychoactive drugs, and I’ve only ever done Cannabis and Nitrous Oxide before (And both combined a few times, I must say I love the combination) to any effect, and while I tried Harmala with Cannabis in preparation for this, I cannot say whether I was feeling anything from the Harmala at that time. Whether this unfamiliarity makes me more sensitive to the effects of various psychoactives because I’m not used to them or, conversely, makes me less sensitive because my walls of perception have not been fully breached yet, I cannot tell for sure. Secondly, this report is a combination of reflections I have regarding the session and actual things I described to my friend via instant messaging during the experience, slightly edited for improved readability, and the time stamps are sometimes far from accurate. Thirdly, I chose to consume the finely ground Harmala and Hostilis as is, without resorting to making a tea or anything of the sort. This is because I felt confident my stomach could handle it, and because I felt as if it was the best way to make sure I get 100% of the compounds into my system. I was thinking that a filtered extraction might lose some of it if not prepared thoroughly enough. I also chose to wait 10-15 minutes between the Harmala and the Hostilis, not to waste any of the DMT passing through my system while the Harmala hasn’t activated yet. My close friend (who introduced me) did it this way, and it worked like a charm for him. Finally, the thoughts and experiences described in this first report do not necessarily reflect my current views on me, the drug or the universe in general. I’ve had two more sessions in the week or so that has passed since this, and I’ve had a lot of time to revise my views. Those revisions will be explored further down the line, as I find it important to first share my thoughts as they were at the time. With these things said, we shall move on to… The Trip T+00:00 Consumed 2 grams of finely ground Harmala seeds (like very fine flour) with the aid of orange juice. Not nearly as foul tasting as I had expected, although the intensity of the taste forced me to swallow it quickly. Slight aftertaste that is neutral, or even slightly pleasant (call me crazy). T+10-15 min Ate 1 gram of finely ground Mimosa Hostilis (again, like flour). The Mimosa is a lot harder to swallow than the Harmala, as it acts like actual flour and sticks to the tongue and roof of the mouth. The taste is not very pleasant, but easy to endure thanks to the juice. Feeling slightly nervous since there’s no turning back, but not that worried due to the low dosage. T+20 min I’m starting to feel something in the system. The usual brain fog is lighter, and my thoughts feel clearer. It might be the early effects of the Harmala, or just my imagination going places. T+35 min Feeling very relaxed. My body is telling me to go lie down and turn off the lights. All things visual are slightly tiresome, as are sounds. Lost balance for a second while trying to walk around in my room for a bit, but regained it immediately. T+45 min I’m definitely feeling some effects now. My thoughts are drifting, and I’m seeing some slight movements in my peripheral vision. My body is telling me, almost angrily, to lie down. Some slight nausea is also present, as expected. I went to the bathroom. Sat down on the WC for a few minutes, and the thoughts were getting more erratic. The patterns on the bathroom floor were moving slightly, in a way that reminds me of waves on an ocean. Have to focus slightly to type coherently, or I drift off into random thoughts. Unsure if this is as far as it goes, I only took 1 gram after all. Also, my sense of time feels off, as if slowed down. I’m getting a feeling as if time isn’t really relevant. Going to lie down in my bed for a while T+55 min Don’t feel like lying down anymore. I’m having rather intense visuals whenever I close my eyes and let go, of odd geometric patterns, and some kind of clockwork. Spinning gears with animals slithering around between then. Also drifting in and out of reality, a bit like when you’re just about to fall asleep. The nausea is growing strong. I went to the bathroom, turned off the lights, and sat down on the floor with my head leaning over the WC, expecting to purge. During this time, I was drifting between realities. A lot of them were defined by fractal patterns. All fractals had an empty circle in the middle of them, as far as I can remember. Some of these realities were weird to the point of being indescribable. I’m calling them realities not because I’m convinced they’re real, but because they weren’t just visual. A lot of times I somehow *remembered* things from these odd places, and on one occasion I found myself staring at a mother and her daughter just below a ski slope. More people were behind me, but I don’t know how I know that, because there were no sounds and I didn’t look in that direction. I felt as if they were all my family, but I know for a fact that these were no people I’ve ever known. I never got to purge, although with every attempt my body curled up with a feeling that purging was really important. Even to the point where it felt as if the meaning of all existence was to get rid of that feeling of nausea that kept clouding my mind. I want to think clearly, but the calls from my stomach are too loud and distracting. T+1 h 25 min Still don’t need much willpower to stay with the outside world. It is so easy to let go, though, and drift away. The realities come and go, and they feel so real until I leave them. This is so very different from a cannabis high. I’m pretty sure I’m in a state of higher-than-normal mental clarity. So many things to think about, and it’s so easy to focus my thoughts if I want to. Strange thoughts come to me, but I can easily tell them apart from the outside world. This reality seems so irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. So many others are passing by, just as easily as people passing me by on the street. This is an insane experience, but it is so very beautiful. T+1 h 40 min I’ve realized now that I’ve always had these voices in my mind and in my body, telling me whether the things I’m doing are wrong and right. I’ve just turned down the volume gradually throughout the years. I haven’t heard these in so many years. From the beginning, “I” was just a collection of these voices, with a central unit (consciousness) that can listen in to them. Really simple and primitive voices, which know nothing except for the things they exist to do, but on a large scale they exhibit something resembling intelligent thought. There is definitely something inside of me that can choose to turn the volume on these voices up or down. Just like a mixer table. These voices are the building blocks of consciousness. Even these primitive voices are conscious to a degree, however simple that consciousness might seem. It is too hard, however, to keep track of all these separate voices. Lots and lots of these simple voices are grouped up together by purpose, categorized by our consciousness and form a common voice. This has to be done, because if every voice had their say all the time, the self would be in a state of constant chaos and turmoil. This voice is more complex than all of its parts. Just like a group of individuals uniting in a common cause, forming hierarchies and systems of governance, these voices start to exhibit group behavior on larger scales. These groups of voices will in turn be grouped up with other groups operating on the same scale, and become even more complex, until they ultimately form the thing we come to think of as “I”. If you think of every one of these voices as a person, then the “I” is a lot like the world we are living in. There is a very beautiful fractal-like symmetry in this. This system is not perfect, however. These voices are simple and do not understand the meaning of moderation. The further down the hierarchy you go, the simpler they become, until they are little more than streams of pure intent. If the consciousness focuses too much attention on one particular voice (or set of voices), it will get too accustomed to it. These voices will get too much attention, and grow selfish. Let them have their way all the time and they will grow complacent. They will keep crying even when their initial demands are met, resulting in a constant screaming for attention. This is how bad habits and addictions are formed. This also means that other voices also in need of attention will start to fade until they become background noise. The consciousness might not notice or care, but the background noise never stops. These voices cry out for a reason, which is to make sure that we take care of our mind and body. This means that if the consciousness does not listen, it will never find out the reason behind their crying and therefore never solve the problem. The voices will keep crying. This clogs the machinery and slows down thought, because the consciousness is limited in capacity. Compare this to a tyrannical society falling apart when the institutions can no longer handle the amount of petitions or uprisings by displeased citizens. If the people are happy, the government has more time to spend on other things. It is possible to listen in on voices at a lower level. This takes a lot of practice, a lot of listening. I feel as if the fine-tuning of the consciousness can be done by listening inwards, and that this is the way to cultivate happiness, contentedness and clarity of mind. Listen to your inner voices, the way a benevolent ruler listens to his people, and your voices will love you. And, since these voices are all part of you, this means that you will learn to love yourself proper. This perspective on things is a bit complicated to live with. Thinking of every single part of my body as being a figurative planet of really primitive people with their own lives and history that need to have their demands met makes it too complex to handle. One must find and maintain a balance, where one listens just closely enough to keep the mind and body satisfied, but keeps enough of a distance to not get overwhelmed by it all. T+2 h 10 min It’s been great to feel so close and connected to the inner self, but it’s all so complicated, and there’s so much information. It would be great with just a little bit of silence. Just a little bit. “Just a little bit”. That’s how it always starts. And the people have no clue what’s going on. Their liberties slowly stripped away. It is scary how closely the outside world resembles the self. I’ve been rambling on for a long time now. The nausea is still present. It eats away at the consciousness, and doesn’t let me think as clearly as I would like. I wish it would get loud enough to give me a reason to do… whatever a dictatorship does to people who don’t agree with the imagined “cause” for which it strives. Having more thoughts, about whether our universe in turn can be viewed as a simple building block of something on a much higher plane, where it can be considered a “voice” in a much more complicated consciousness, or, if you choose, one person in a much more complex world. Maybe this cosmic consciousness also struggles to maintain some kind of self-identity amidst all the chaos. I’m not sure of these things now that I reflect upon them, but they make a great thought experiment. Realities keep coming and going gently through all this. It is very much a pleasant experience so far. T+2 h 30 min This perspective shines a whole new light on what it means to interact with other people. It is like separate nations are exchanging knowledge and opinions with each other, civilizations with long histories, and many people with histories of their own living in them. The thought is beautiful beyond words. And the separate “people” feel so happy if you give them the slightest chance to tell you what it means to be them. They have a lot of things to say about it though. And I feel like I’m being a little bit repetitive. The voices speaking from within me now are so much more varied than the small group of tyrants I’m used to listening to. Much more interesting, and it makes me as a person more interesting as well. (Between this time and T+3 h I’m not very coherent, and there isn’t a lot to say about it. I chose to let go for a bit and just enjoy myself.) T+3 h I forced myself to have an opinion on religion and God. Religion (as it feels to me, right now) is just a way for the inner voices to handle things. They choose to believe that someone is listening to them, because the thought of this not being the case is almost unbearable. They exist to be listened to, after all. As for whether such a god exists or not, I cannot say. But this is how religion as a concept looks and feels to me right now. I’m pondering some more about these voices. If I’m not talking to any of these separate voices in person, then I do not know any of them closely enough to call them a friend. This would mean I’m not very close to myself. I’m a stranger in my own mind. This thought is more fascinating than scary. I’ve realized how much better any interaction with other people gets if you decide to listen with interest, rather than doing it per social code and care for 10% of what is said. This is hard to do, but it can be done. And it is so much more interesting than listening to the same voices over and over, echoing against the emptiness inside. It is also interesting to note how unimportant it feels to force these realizations down others’ throats. They might not need them right now, or agree with them. The things they need to realize might be completely different from these. Also, I have myself to discuss with now. The parts of myself I didn’t know existed. T+4 h – 7 h I’m definitely coming down, however gently. It feels as if days have passed, if that even matters. It’s a funny feeling to sit and talk/think of your body as a collective of separate beings. It’s harder to justify abusing a whole civilization than only abusing yourself. I’m just a moderator in a very rowdy community, and it is my responsibility to make sure that all parts of my mind and body have a say in things. My capacity to listen in might be limited, but it is supposed to be enough. (Not much to add after this. I sent some conversation logs to a couple of friends for them to read. One of them noted that it sounded to him as if I had explained “divinity”, one voice for all voices, which is what the collective of voices would be to the individual, on any scale.) Final reflections This was definitely an enlightening experience. Many of the thoughts and ideas are a bit fuzzy, which isn’t that odd as they are very much a work in progress, and some of them have already been revised, but I feel like I’ve gained a lot from this. It wasn’t as intense or glowing as the following two trips, but by no means less valuable. I hope it has been an interesting read. I’ll return with more recent thoughts and experiences as soon as I’ve gotten my lazy ass to compile them. Thanks for the time.

"Experience:300Âµg AL-LAD - Don't worry, because you're everyone!","Initial Dosage: I stick the tabs on my gum like my fellow psychonaut instructs me to. I leave the tabs there for about half an hour before I chew & swallow them. Approx. An hr after initial dosage: I'm feeling slightly different, then my friend says something & I automatically start bursting out in uncontrollable laughter. They inform me that this is normal as I continue in my hysteria. I also felt my throat become fairly flemmy around this sort of time, my friend says they also find they get like this on AL-LAD. Approx. Half an hour later: I'm feeling an intense body high. Feeling as if I'm having an orgasm, but all over my body, along with feeling this sort of buzzing energy, hard to describe. I see my first visual as I'm showing my friend the contents of “The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide” by James Fadiman, it's in between the lines & kind of looks like a triangle but curvy, There's probably a name for it but it escapes me at this time, I shall update if I figure it out. Approx. Half an hour later: I'm lying on the bed, along with my friend & we can see the ceiling in motion, which gives me great pleasure to look at. I have this state of mind where I look at our species as strange, we try to define things, “this means this & that means that” I keep repeating to myself, & I keep saying “none of it matters!” I want to go out and share how I'm feeling with everyone & tell them of this new insight, but I'm afraid I will get shot by the police for being mistaken as a lunatic. I'm thinking that the Illuminati as the cause of all this, they're the ones that behind all the defining, controlling the media & so forth telling us what to think & what things mean, but in truth meaning to things always changes. I keep saying the same sentence over & over again, along with my friend who I believe is doing the same thing. I'm still very giggly at this point, I start taking off some of the layers I have on (which I have several of), saying something along the lines of “I'm removing this because it's not me, it's not who I am.” my friend asks me not to start taking my clothes off so I stop at the point where I'm left with only a t-shirt on & tracksuit bottoms. My friend instructs me to try & meditate, but I'm too giggly & easily distracted. I lie down next to the boiler in their room, laughing & smiling for a while. Around 12:50 AM: Note:From here on out I completely lose track of time. I've been so engrossed in my experience that I forgot to count down for the new year with my friend. By now , geometric patterns have completely enveloped my vision, I see them on the walls, I see them on my friend, they're everywhere! We continue to converse for a while, then at some point, it gets really weird. Now, the experience is jumbled. I'm not sure what order these experiences happen, but I will give it my best shot to remember the correct order. I believe I'm seeing the person who I have feelings for, & they find out how I'm feeling & instead of rejecting me as I fear is going to be the case, they say ""I love you too!"" & we start kissing and then our bodies start melting into each other. The pleasure & happiness I'm feeling is amazing! It's so beautiful! I feel so happy that I don't have to worry any more! By now I'm completely out of it &, according to my friend, completely unresponsive. So me and this person continue with our melt-sex for a while & then they don't want to because I'm not (a certain person), & now I go into this odd loop where I become different people who I know or (admire for e.g. Terrence Mckenna), & I feel like these people are also spectating me becoming them, speaking to, & talking about me, & each time it speeds up dramatically & is also slightly different. From going back to being me melting with that person, to being them melting into me, to eventually being someone I know who has alzheimers, I resist it at first, I don't like it one bit, I feel as if I'm shutting down & I can see rats, spiders, snakes & some other creepy creatures with evil red eyes from the other side of the room that are coming towards me. At first, I think I've turned into Sonic, & that I can jump out the window, run around the world a light speed & come back & then I'll be able to move on to a better experience, (which thinking about it sounds illogical because even if I could do that, in theory they wouldn't have gone anywhere as I would have been back in an instant giving them no time to even go anywhere), my friend fortunately stops me from doing this as I would have fallen & injured myself badly. At this point I see my friend, who instructs me to lie down, which helps me a lot. I now feel like I'm meant to leave this person I'd fallen in love with, so I could go deeper into my mind & face my fears along with the help of Terrence McKenna. I feel a giant dog sized spider crawl on top of my head, but instead of freaking out, I find it cuddly & warm. I feel as if I've been taken to the Amazon & I'm with these creatures again, but instead of them being scary, they're just minding their own business & I'm minding mine. Then I'm taken to this space where the loop continues, I start living lives of other people, at least my perception of them & being them or melting with them, I change & be someone else & live out their life & so on, then I experience melting into people as someone else with someone else. I felt like I was a piece of a puzzle & that these other people I'm seeing are the other pieces of the puzzle & feel I must merge with these people to become whole again. I In the end these people tell me something like, ""You don't need to worry about us doing things you don't want us to, because we are you"", & I have this feeling of complete connection with everyone, I feel as if I am everyone. It goes something along these lines. Although this has been updated there are most likely things I'm still missing out & some things I'm missing out simply because I can't describe to you how it felt at the time. Around half 5 AM: I awaken and find myself lying next to my friend who is on their phone. I see no visuals, other than an enhanced perception of the phone, it looks almost 3D, & more colorful, it's pretty awesome. My friend informs me that I had grabbed their light and snapped it, that they had to stop me from from burning myself on their candle & that I started saying a load of random stuff. I have no recollection of this, but I remember seeing a candle at some point during the trip. I apologise to them & we go to sleep.

Experience: 25ug ALD-52 - Untitled,"Last night I had some free time and some materials but I wasn’t sure how hard I wanted to throw myself at the wall, so I ripped and ate 1/4 of a tab. At a later date I consumed the other 3/4 of the tab and confirmed it was evenly dosed. Began by laying on the futon and listening to TV, cuddling with my partner with my eyes closed, being already fairly high from cannabis. Around 30 minutes into the experience a slight body high emerges. This slowly grows over the next hour or so. At T+90m I go out for another bowl. I’d taken a therapeutic dose of Lorazepam (0.5mg) around T-4h, and so topped up another 0.5mg around the T+90m mark. I wasn’t feeling super anxious but did this to prevent being surprised by a Lorazepam comedown while on psychedelics. It was continuing to intensify at T+4H when I would normally be at the peak of an LSD experience, but “intensify” is the wrong word because it was a very calm and relaxed experience. I didn’t get the electric tingling body high I do from LSD, more like my entire body was embraced in a warm hug. I don’t know if this comes from expectations from having read about it, because scientifically I would expect identical affects to LSD, but I’m not complaining at all and hope to find this again. Around this time we moved to the bedroom and sex was somewhat enhanced, and afterwards I went back down to the basement for lights out yoga and meditation. At this point the 25ug was working it’s very hardest. Experienced vibrating vision (I think due to eye twitching — never experienced this on LSD but have read about it on DMT/MET), and in downward facing positions the carpet would somewhat spin, as if a 6-inch circle was cut out and being rotated, but no characteristic warping. Listened to a meditation video and while the headspace wasn’t much different from sobriety I was able to experience the totality of my sensory input without judgment for a few fleeting seconds at a time, which is my goal in meditation. After I came back upstairs I enjoyed another bowl and straddled the edge between level 3 and level 4 closed eye geometry. Keep in mind I achieve level 3 on cannnabis very regularly, so this was only slightly more complex thanks to the ALD-52. Around T+7h I joined my partner in bed and the next thing I remember was her telling me she’s leaving for work. Apparently no difficulty falling asleep (had Trazodone on standby) and slept straight through her getting ready this morning. 5/5 would take this dose again, but I might be cautious about microdosing ALD-52. It does a lot in small amounts. Submitted by Maethor1337","['geometry', 'vibrating vision']",605
Experience: 40mg 5-MeO-DMT (oral) + 40mg MXE (oral) - Untitled,"After not breaking through on my previous experience with 5-MeO-DMT, I decided that I was going to do everything I could to make sure I broke through this time. I loaded 42mg of MXE into a gelcap, and then topped it off with 40mg of 5-MeO-DMT. I sat down on the couch, put the cap in my mouth and washed it down. The effects from the 5MeO hit me first, it started with partially defined geometrical visuals, which evolved very rapidly into men on horses flying through the sky, these were the men who guided me to the entrance of the void. The body high was overwhelming and I had no desire to move. The MXE started to hit, and Shiva took me into the void. Something important that I learned from the Aghora book, is that Shiva permanently intoxicated with Samadhi-consciousness, and that the Aghori take intoxicants to better self identify with Shiva. As I entered the void, Shiva and I became one, and guided me on my journey. At this point, I would say my visuals were reaching the point where I was seeing intensely intricate designs, mostly beams of light, of all colors, fusing together to create the surroundings. He took me to the center of all universes, the pure source energy that I have felt so many times before, but this time, it fractalized out in all directions. At this point, I had a hard time distinguishing from myself or the rest of the universe, it really did not matter, because I was everything that everything else was. I forgot who I was for a while, and only identified with Shiva. Eventually, I managed to regain a sliver of my ego, and remembered I was myself. When that happened, my data become fragmented. I am pretty sure this is the point where I first vomited, because I remember going into the bathroom and purging the ego. Despite being in the void, I still had a tiny bit of consciousness in this world, and was able to open my eyes for about two seconds at a time and move myself around like a drunk. The entire time I was purging I was experiencing visuals similar to what mainstream culture portrays licking toads as, very bright fractalizing colors constantly changing. I finally made my way back to the couch to lay back down and entered this purple void. It was a seemingly never ending expanse of purple, and I remember turning into geometry and flying through it. Eventually I made my way to the end, where I remained for a LONG time. Shiva was no longer with me at this point, so I was left to experience this part by myself. It felt like an eternity that I spent in this place, this end of the purple void where I was stuck. I remember thinking, that I was going to be stuck here forever. I had many revelations about myself during this time, which then made me go purge some more. After that, I was out of the place I was stuck and began making my way back to the real world. At this point, I still had visuals, it started as fully 3d geometry, but moved down to just partially defined not long after. I felt the MXE for a few hours afterwards, but I mostly wanted to sober up. The duration of my 5-MeO-DMT trip only lasted about an hour and a half, but the duration of it felt like two or three months. This 5-MeO-DMT experience was really exciting and beautiful, but stressful at times. I am much more pleased with the results of consuming it orally than when we smoked it. What D experienced smoking the 5-MeO-DMT seems much different than what I experienced, so I am curious about the different effects of taking it in different ways. I have read about 5-MeO-DMT being used in ayahuasca brews, so I am thinking about putting it inside one of those ayahuasca smoothies… Submitted by - Humandestiny","['and landscapes', 'autonomous entities', 'geometry', 'internal hallucinations', 'memory suppression', 'nausea', 'sceneries', 'settings', 'spontaneous physical sensations', 'time distortion', 'unity and interconnectedness']",830
Experience:40 mg 4-HO-MPT - Underwhelming Experience,"I weighted out 40 mg of 4-HO-MPT, and stuff it into a gel capsule. I haven't eaten in 12 hours, specifically to avoid nausea. 0 min - Nothing to do with the experience, but I notice some of it landed on my thumb, and I decide to taste it. It was one of the worst tasting substances I've come across. 15 min - Mild nausea sets in. Also, my jaw feels pretty numb. 30 min - Nausea has been elevated to moderate, and I'm having difficulty hearing anything. 1 hour - I am experiencing severe nausea, and it's impossible to make out what anyone is saying in this movie I'm watching, due to the auditory hallucinations. I now see the pattern repetition, but also, I taste blood. I check several times, but I'm not bleeding. Slight drifting. 2 hours - The only development in the last hour is that my head is numb, and my mouth is burning. Still nauseous. 3 hours - No changes, and by this time if anything interesting were to happen, I'd know. 4 hour, 30 min I'm starving, and my nausea has dissipated. I reheat some Chinese food, and when I eat it, it tastes like dirt. 6 hours Nothing at all seems to happening now. I feel disappointed in the substance, but at least now I won't have to wonder about it anymore. I saw several people on forums have similarly disappointing experiences, but I just wanted to be sure. I think there are only 2 explanations as to why this trip played out like it did: A) The dosing information is wildly inaccurate, and should be much higher. This would make it impractical to research 4-HO-MPT through oral administration, but I doubt this is the reason, considering the levels of nausea I reached with just 40 mg. B) This is just the 4-HO-MPT experience, which unfortunately seems to be the case. Either way, I can't in good faith recommend this substance.","['auditory suppression', 'drifting', 'gustatory hallucination', 'nausea', 'symmetrical texture repetition']",423
Experience:30mg 4-HO-MiPT - Positively groovy,"Background I had just finished my finals for summer courses a few hours prior, and felt pretty confident in them. I now had nothing but time, no responsibilities, so I figure I might as well try this out. I figured it would be similar to Moxy, which wasn't really the case, but was still a great experience. I weigh out 30mg of 4-HO-MiPT, and I take it orally. Timeline Start - I immediately start chastising myself for not planning this out better. I usually get very nauseous with tryptamines, and fast for several hours beforehand. However, I forgot I just ate about a pound and a half of Chinese food, and I prepare myself for the worst. 25 min - Instead of the expected nausea, I'm greeted by a wave of physical euphoria. I don't believe I had felt this good in at least 6 months. No visuals yet. 30 min - I abruptly start having wholly unique CEVs, and I'm dying laughing. As opposed to tessellations and other such patterns I usually see, it looks like an old cartoon. As in Steamboat Willie old. An amazing interactive cartoon is playing in my head, and I'm fully captivated by it. 1 hour - A cigarette sounds pretty good right now, so I go outside. I sit down, lift my head up, and notice how beautiful it is today. The trees wave at me, the oranges on a tree turn into sleeping cherubs. I draw from the cigarette, and the smoke is really cold, as if it was intense menthol, which it wasn't. After the smoke, I sit and enjoy the yard for a while. 1 hour 30 min - The euphoria really picks up, and my whole body is buzzing and glowing. The glow oscillates around my body, as if my diaphragm was a lighthouse. I acknowledge that this is the best day I've had in a long time, and I feel deeply fulfilled. It's as if this experience makes up for all the bullshit that goes on with me. 3 hours - All effects are holding steady, and I look out my window. There's a cat in my neighborhood that hangs out in my backyard occasionally, and he's there now. He has white paws at the ends of his black legs, but right now they look like clouds he's standing on. Another laughing fit results from this. 4-5 hours - The trip winds down, but very gradually, almost so I don't even notice that things are normal again. After it's obvious that the bulk of the trip is over with, I notice how tired I am. I'm still not able for sleep for a few hours, but I eventually get there. Epilogue This substance is definitely a new favorite of mine. Partly because of the range of fantastic effects and also from the lack of negatives. I almost always get nauseous from tryptamines, even if I fast for 12 or more hours, but not with this. I honestly don't have a single critique of this substance, I wholeheartedly endorse it.

Experience:4-HO-MiPT / A care free psychedelic getaway,"I am quite an experienced psychedelic user, new to the RC scene however. I've eaten mushrooms more times than I can count, mostly 5+ years ago and almost always at the 3.5g dose range. A few times recently but have only worked up to a couple grams. Most of this report will be transcribed, edited/added to from a notepad where I took notes throughout most of the experience. I tested this substance orally at 5mg 2 weeks prior with great results. Incredible body high, altered thought, bright room, insanely happy, increased pot euphoria, quite horny, temp retreat from stresses[didn't even cross mind for 4 hours] 0 min: I took a pre weighed gel cap with a sip of water on a mostly empty stomach. My plan was to watch TV until I felt it and then go with the flow. I was already slightly baked on some nice headband by Tweed. Great cheap medical cannabis. 25 min: Overly smiley and giggly at stupid TV show which I often find annoying.' 1 h: Definitely tripping now. The light in the room slowly got brighter and brighter the past hour and everything is slightly morphing.' Start listening to music via my phones speakers. It's a fairly recently downloaded electronic mix and it's almost good but somewhat unsettling. I remember not wanting to play music on my PC's speakers for some reason.. 1 h, 15 min: I decide to switch my monitors to my kickass desktop wallpaper slideshow and lie down on the couch and try to notice any CEVs. 'CEVs which are themed by one of my wallpapers [A majestic picture of a lion and sunset] slowly start to develop with symmetry and dance to the music, which is starting to get good and feel less unsettling.' Colored outlines making a lion head in an almost kaleidoscope pattern.. Amazing but not as strong as previous trip CEVs. 1 h, 30 min: Very visually psychedelic without much push.' When lying down I sure felt like I could see things from a very shifted perspective, tho it was somewhat mentally retarding. 'I roll out my yoga mat and start dancing on it.' Feels great on my now bear feet. 1 h, 45 min: Very smiley while meditating on the couch.' Quite distracted and not properly able to focus and meditate, rather relax in position and enjoy the CEVs. I remember a wild visual of the upper torso of a bald munk looking man with a waterfall of sorts coming out of his face and running down his body and I remember the water taking an anti gravity effect and spiraling around him with snake-like scales. It was not super strong, but with eyes closed it crept up to about 50% opacity. Fucking wild and wish I could have made it stronger. I should have at this point tested weather CEV's wear stronger with eyes in a pillow[pitch black] or while facing in the direction of a light source like monitor, lamp, or candle. I remember doing this later once the visuals started to wear off and it was tough to tell a difference. 1 h, 50 min: Time to smoke some pot.' I loaded a fat one hitter into my bong [indica this time] and hit it hard, immediately wishing that I smoked sooner. It was at this point that the come up anxiety faded rather quickly and I switched to a more chilled out mix on my itunes. Actually being able to feel the bass via these real speakers is amazing 'but writing and formulating structured sentences is very hard.' It took me like 5 minutes to write 'formulating structured sentences' in my notes haha. Definitely feeling the trypt toes [a familiar tightness in the tendons of my feet whenever I take a decent dose of acid or shrooms. Slippers help] 2 h: Mind numbing without any push. Super psychedelic doe.. Chill music is fucking amazing. Previous mix was too bouncy and hyped, was contributing to come up anxiety I think. 'Gonna smoked more pot in hopes of keeping it going.' 2 h, 15 min: Listening to a familiar mix on itunes should be a standard when testing, along with hand written trip reports to be transcribed and added to next day' Exploded my pajama pants crotch when jumping off the couch excitedly to write previous note lol. 2 h, 20 min: I find my music and desktop wallpaper rotation hysterically awesome. It's a care free psychedelic getaway. I look fucking great in the mirror.' Serious I thought I looked sexy as fuck. 2 h, 30 min: It's time to test a beer. I am hoping to soon get hungry and devour pizza. I must say before cracking the molsen I feel fucking amazing/incredible/holy fucking shit! Great body high.' After a couple sips of a Molsen Canadian tallboy I feel a little more human and decide to try some trailmix. It was damn good and causes me to heat up a slice of pizza. 2 h, 45 min: Literally everything is awesome. Everything I throw at it gets better and better.' I start listening to a favorite deep house mix and wrote mind 'meltingly great :)!' 3 h, 30 min: Next time go deeper def. Maybe 18mg with a beer and indica right off the hop.' At this point I had two tall beers, equal to 4 reg beers and the trip mostly wore off other than brightness, mood lift, and music appreciation. I thought of taking a 5mg bump to see if I could bring any of it back, but decided with all the booze in me it would be a waste. I could tell that I would have no problem sleeping soon so why start the ball rolling again. 4 h: Wish I had chocolate! -- found some! gum is great too, go figure!' All in all I'd say I had a fantastic time on this substance. Felt completely normal the next morning, a little better than normal infact. It seems to have almost all the psychedelic nature of the mushroom but without the push or nausea. Mother nature doesn't whisper to you like with the shroom, at least not at these low doses. I plan to do more testing this summer with this and other substances, ideally out in nature.

Experience:4-HO-MET 22mg oral,"Me and my GF took 22mg 4-ho-met, started playing a card game, when it finished we really felt we had to lie down. In bed we cuddle for an hour or so with a huge body load. Then it was over. So all the physical effects of mushrooms with none of the psychedelic ones, except for thick, slightly blurry vision at common dosage. No nausea whatsoever. Felt cold. Didn't feel like any sort of seratonin/noradrenalin/dopamine alteration. Kind of a let down. Afterwards we didn't experience the exhaustion often accompanied with mushrooms either. Unsure of its application. Date rape drug? No it's too clear headed. Maybe a novelty for kids. We might try increasing the dose but these properties aren't what we're searching for in a psychedelic substance, maybe I'll just buy 4-aco-dmt instead next time.

Experience:4-HO-MET â 15 mg Insufflated,"Introduction As I had slept way too much, I had the spare time to try out a new psychedelic during the night. 4-HO-MET was one of the choices and its duration made it quite practical. I didn’t know very much of the drug, but most of what I had heard and read gave me the impression that it would be very similar to shrooms. Only that association has been the reason for me to have this lying around for so long. Now I just went for it and was pleasantly amazed. T+0:00 (6:15) The taste wasn’t pleasant, but I’ve tasted worse. As I was tidying up around me I already noticed some visual distortions. They seem to have vivid, kind appearance. I quickly change my music into some techno, instead of the Hardcore / Frenchcore I was listening to. Apart from a slight stomach ache, all is well as of now. The visuals are extremely intense, which I admire at the moment. T+0:30 The effects a fully noticeable. I enjoy how pc programs have built in warnings to prevent spelling and grammar mistakes. The music I listen to is amazing, while this is a liveset I’ve listened to like a million times. The visual paters from this drug aren’t really like any I’ve ever seen before. They appear strong in both their vividness and their message. I think message is the right word for it. T+2:00 I’ve been trying to get the first page’s tables’ lay-out the way I wanted until now. Just had a few small chats on tinychat, but other than that, the lay out is all that kept me busy. I do notice that the effects are slowly starting to fade away already. Which makes me feel disappointed, as opposed to many other psychedelics. T+2:30 I’ll take this moment to describe the feelings throughout the trip, as that didn’t really happen, since I got distracted by alignment issues that were caused by, as I now realise, my own visual distortions. The general feeling has been free and somewhat euphoric. Overall I felt as if I was capable of doing almost anything, but in practice this turned out a misconception. Distractions and perfectionism developed into an obstruction. Ah, whatever, I’ll just throw everything in the conclusion. Conclusion: The drug was nothing like I had expected, but it was an amazingly colourful and overall just beautiful experience. To me personally, it lacked depth, but the mind blowing visual display made up for that. The experience was very short lasting, but it was truly a visual festival. Next to the, throughout the entire trip, extraordinarily vivid colours, the patterns and structures were different from what I remember from last time I did psychedelics. Especially the precise detail of the patterns’ path. Beautiful swirls, made up of extremely high definition dots, that each had a its very own indescribably bright colour.

"Experience:4-HO-DET (20 mg, oral) - Tripping for my birthday","It was my birthday party at my best friend house, I brought some 4-HO-DET, we were 9 at the party. Me and 3 of us wish to try the substance, there were J ( 20 years old) that already experience psychedelic but only in party, she never do it in house that took 20mg, U ( 18 years old) that is my best friend that never experienced any psychedelic took 20mg, I ( 19 years old) took 20mg and M ( 17 years old) that never experienced psychedelic too was a bit afraid of taking the same amount of us, so she took 15mg. T+0:45 - Start feeling tingling and warm sensation for all of us T+1:00 – Closed eyes visuals appears and the environment starts breathing for all of us T+1:30 - Visuals are a bit more intense than my last trip with 1P-LSD, visual drifting with a heavy breathing and flowing, I start yawning a lot and that excessive yawning will last all the trip long (It seem that I was the only one affected by the excessive yawning), I started to laugh to nothing, I laugh alone for at least 10 minutes. T+2:00 - M start to get stuck in a thought loop about the moon that smile to her and U start to have a déj vu that I noticed later too, we were all feel bliss, loving each other T+2:20 - I sat on the carpet alone in the room to make the most of the feeling when I touch the carpet and be amazed of how beautiful the close eyes visual were, they could be geometric but some time I saw my closed eyes visual melting and color mixing together. I saw many times fractals like Mandelbrot's fractals. T+2:30 - At this moment our head space was really psychedelic with some spark of clarity make talking to each other and watching my other friends drunk really fun T+2:40 - Feel really warm even outside with an average temperature of 10°C, I smoke some cigarettes with U, M and J and some other friends and it feel really weird the warm sensation intensifies and some tactile sensation enhancement T+3:00 - The head space became less psychedelic, easier to handle for I and J, feel a mild body load when I sat or lie on a couch. I and U feel intense wave of physical and cognitive euphoria T+between +3:00 and +3:40- Start to feel sad, the trip intensifies but It was still pretty manageable and didn't last long. I notice that on white wall I can saw the same pattern that I saw when I close my eyes. I also noticed after image with bright elements T+4:00 - Start to feel the come down, I alternate between psychedelic head space and clear head space, but the clear head space start to be more and more presents, and visual tend to be less intense T+5:00 - No more visual drifting, some mild breathing effect are still there, and closed eyes visual less intense, I tried to sleep even if I feel still pretty energetic and I don't feel the need to sleep I feel pretty tired After the wake up, no more effect for all of us I wasn't all the time with theme so we didn't a reunion to talk how was there trip They noticed, some color shifting, déj vu, M had some external hallucination like shadow people and report seeing faces and eyes everywhere during the trip, and we're all stuck at some time in a thought loop TLDR: I experienced 4HO-DET with 3 friends at my birthday party, I was a really good time for all of us, we were all feel bliss, really visual trip. I didn't expect the psychedelic head be that much present but that was only the case for the first half of the trip, the second half was an easier head space and my friend who take the smaller dose has seen shadow people Submitted by GIGA30","['breathing', 'drifting', 'dã©jã vu', 'excessive yawning', 'external hallucination', 'flowing', 'geometry', 'laughter fits', 'melting', 'pattern recognition enhancement', 'tactile enhancement', 'temperature regulation suppression', 'thought loops']",830
Experience:4-AcO-DMT + 200mg Pill,"I had several friends round for my 18th birthday, although at the time I was currently 17 as it was an early party. We had been drinking from around 6 O’clock but I drink cider, and I drink it so slowly that I may as well be sipping water as I do not feel drunk at all. I have always been wanting to try different drugs that I discover here on psychonaut. I had 10 25mg 4-AcO-DMT gel tabs. Around 7:50 my friends take half a tab each or roughly 12.5mg of 4-Aco. My mum knew that my friends did drugs but she did not know that I did. I had intended to wait until midnight as I knew my mum would be home at 10:30, but I caved and decided to drop at 8 pm. I dropped a whole tab. I continued to drink and around 9 pm I started to come up. I don’t really remember what the come up was like but I remember at around 10 O’clock I felt extremely relaxed, maybe even ‘monged out’. At first, I thought some decorations I had were breathing but I realized it was the air purifier I had one; all my friends were smoking and I had a family meal the next morning with the other half of my family so I didn’t want my clothes to smell of weed. I don’t know if the weed in the room altered the trip although I did feel somewhat stoned from the second-hand smoke. 4-AcO felt extremely like acid but slightly different. I was getting tracers and all the similar visual distortions associated with acid, if I didn’t know what I had taken I would claim it to be LSD. Also, I should note that I had a 27mg Ritalin around 7 am but that should have worn off and not affected the trip. Around 10:30 my mum comes home and instantly notices I’m under the influence but she didn’t seem affected by it. Around 12 am my friends and I decided to drop a pill, “white Moncler”. My friends used to exclusively do pills every weekend from March 2017 up until July where we moved onto psychedelics. I remember one of my friends claiming that they had reached their limit as they had drunk copious amounts of wine as well as a half tab and then proceeded to do a key of coke, I chuckled. Around this time, he and several others leave the house and steal a candy-cane Christmas decoration from one of the neighbors, I had decided to remain because I was waiting for some of my several female friends to arrive. At 12:30 my friends return and the female friends arrive, I offer them some gel tabs which had been in my coat the whole time and had melted into one massive blob. They then nickname 4-AcO “gooey stuff”. At 1 am I start to feel the pill, the next 3 hours are spent trying to not pass out and continuously sweat, I did not enjoy the pill and did not feel in love; never again will I do pills. I’m unsure when but we start to watch films on Netflix as the party had seriously died die, many people had left as they have work or gone to bed. In the end, there was 5 of us watching horror films. The first was “It Follows”, all of us being on “gooey stuff” could not take anything seriously. To explain the film from our twisted viewpoint was that chlamydia was trying to kill people and you had to give chlamydia to other people or it would kill you. The film had if I remember correctly 97% on rotten tomatoes but we all agreed it was awful. Around 3 am I start to come down and we begin to watch sharknado 2. Like the previous film, we tore it apart. Around 5 am I decided to finish off the rest of the 4-AcO and begin to start tripping again. This is where my memory becomes a bit hazy, all I remember was that I didn’t enjoy human centipede and that some film about Worms wasn’t enjoyable either. Everyone went home around 9 am except for three of my friends who had agreed to come to my family meal with me. We went to a local restaurant at 12 pm and I was still tripping a tiny bit in front of my dad and grandparents. I finally got home after the meal around 5 and I fell asleep until 8 pm. I went back to bed and woke up at 1 pm the next day. One strange thing I have noticed is that many personal problems no longer present any pain for me, I no longer feel emotional pain. I don’t know if this is permanent or if this is only for things in the past, will I ever feel pain again? I’m unsure how to feel about that although I suppose some people will see this as a good thing. In conclusion, unless you want to do 4-AcO to cross it off the list I would just do acid instead. I don’t know if my lack of emotional pain caused by the 4-AcO is reproducible or not, but I do not recommend taking 100mg. Some people have detailed amazing hallucinations and color changing on 25mg but this just did not happen for me. Sorry if my details are lacking, I have a bad memory and have never done a trip report before, there really isn’t much to say except it was like acid.

Experience:170mg 4-AcO-DMT - Recklessness rewarded,"I take 300mg Wellbutrin (an SNRI) and 10mg escitalopram (an SSRI) daily. I initially took 50mg 4-AcO-DMT (orally) with 30mg temazepam (a benzodiazepine) to help prevent my natural tendency toward anxiety from souring my trip. I also ate some candied ginger to combat nausea and vasoconstriction I get from 4-AcO-DMT. I spent a few hours having a relatively typical trip -- enjoying music and the substance's visuals intensely, feeling happy, bonding with my cat, and spreading some positivity to people online. After maybe 5 hours I noticed I was coming down, so I (quite recklessly) decided to keep it going. I downed another 120mg 4-AcO-DMT with 30mg temazepam. I didn't quite notice the come up on the second dose, and I was absorbed in a video of someone playing bass (the visual distortions almost seemed to make the neck of the bass stretch to infinity, and to give the player extra arms, though not literally of course). After that had happened, it felt like it hit me all at once. The euphoria and feelings of love/connectedness spiked, and the visuals intensified massively. A cobweb in the ceiling corner seemed to duplicate into a diamond-shaped network. The window pane next to me became a three-dimensional space. Eventually, I began seeing visuals on the flat, featureless ceiling -- shapes (blobby shapes, sometimes English letters) spilling outward from the point my vision was focused on, then later an almost fractal inward spiral of line-based symbols with lots of right angles (nothing like a recognizable language, though). Other visual patterns emerged, but they all centered on the point I was focusing. Feelings of love, connectedness, forgiveness, apology, and overall ecstasy coursed through my mind and body. At one point I spent a short time with my eyes closed and covered, struggling to keep under control and fight the urge to thrash around and shout. When that ended, I felt a more soothing euphoria and began moaning (almost purring) with every exhale. After this, I spent what seemed like the majority of the trip limp with my eyes closed. The CEVs were incredibly colorful and created a wide variety of patterns and shapes, many of which were not centered on one point but rather seemed to be moving in a particular direction. My thoughts raced out of my control, never settling on any one concept or memory for more than a split second. I almost dissociated from my body, only ""noticing"" it as I used it; essentially becoming a disembodied pair of lungs in the colorful, psychedelic void. Probably the most important thing to say about this is that it was the most intense, extended period of physical and mental euphoria I'd ever experienced before in my life. Nothing else had ever even remotely approached it. I spent the whole of the day afterward resting and sleeping, as I was very very worn out. I had a headache that came and went, but it was not too bad. Overall while I know it was reckless to take 170mg of a novel/untested psychedelic like this, it worked out incredibly well, and I'm very glad it happened.","['and sociability enhancement', 'changes in felt bodily form', 'cognitive euphoria', 'colour shifting', 'colour tinting', 'conceptual thinking', 'drifting', 'empathy', 'increased music appreciation', 'internal hallucinations', 'love', 'nausea', 'physical euphoria', 'recursion', 'runny nose', 'thought acceleration', 'thought disorganization', 'unity and interconnectedness', 'vasoconstriction']",707
Experience:70 mg - Overcoming personal problems,"While I was coming up I started watching Planet Earth, and Inside the human cell After a while it started becoming hard to pay attention to anything with too much plot, some and josikins who was trip sitting me sat in darkness listening to music for a while, and I could just see really fine and fast moving visuals covering my field of vision. After I had started to trip a bit harder, I wanted to go out for a walk in the park, but before heading out I really needed to urinate but our roommate was in the bath, so we had to take a detour and went to the bathroom at the supermarket, after I was done doing my business, we just walked around the shop. I was bizarre walking around a supermarket without the goal of buying groceries. I got to people watch and it felt like I saw human beings for the first time in their natural environment, rather than just people shopping I saw them for just people living their lives, doing exactly what I do when I go shopping, We're all in the same boat. After that, we went to the park which was beautiful. We went to the play park and started playing on the swings it was very relaxing. Then I went and played on the new round-a-bout that they had and the noise it makes while spinning around sounded like an alien spacecraft taking off. It shook me up a bit, and I became quite anxious because it started to get really loud and sounded ever so slightly sinister, which was then amplified the longer it went on for. So I decided I wanted to go home because I felt like I needed a change of environment to lighten the mood, and I also got tired all of a sudden and felt like I needed to lay down. When we got home, one of our friend’s from London had arrived and also a few others, and they were about to head out to the pub but I just went straight upstairs because my short term memory was gone at this point, so things were a little confusing and I couldn't really keep track of what was going on. I couldn't follow the conversation, so I thought it was best to go some place where I felt comfortable. So my girlfriend decided to head out with all of our friends, and I stayed home and just relaxed in bed while listening to some instrumental music, and I started thinking about my friends and my girlfriend and I came to the conclusion that I was quite an insecure individual and I remembered this quote that I read on the dalai lama’s twitter account a few weeks ago “there is no room for jealousy, insecurities or anger in a warm, loving heart”, which immediately triggered a feeling of relief as I truly thought about it, I am not going to go into too much detail as it is too personal to mention but in our relationship we had a lot of difficulties when we first got together, and it had quite a severe adverse effect on my psyche, I became quite self-conscious and self-pitied for a long time. So anyway, I called my girlfriend because I was just so happy and I just really wanted to see her. She was at the beach so I got dressed and got my things together as quick as I could and ran out the door. I didn't stop running until I found her. I felt like I was in some romantic comedy searching for him through the streets of my town because I really couldn't wait to see her and tell her that I loved her. When that happened we headed over to a pub because they had a folk night event where anyone can come along and play their instruments and sing along. When we arrived, I sat down with our friends that were already there and I Immediately became quite paranoid. I couldn't keep track of conversation as there was so much going on. Tripping in such a public place wasn't the best idea but it was an experience that I'm glad I had as I had my girlfriend there and friends who I trusted to keep me safe and always reassured me that everything was okay. After about (what felt like) 15 minutes of being there my social circle thought it was probably a good idea to take me home in a more calming environment where I wouldn't have to concentrate on much. My girlfriend and one of my friends left with me the rest stayed, and the walk home was very pleasant because things started to calm down and become less frustrating. I began to feel as though I was purely in the moment when I got home. I was incredibly distractable, and I just wanted to try and be creative by any means possible. I went into the kitchen for a glass of water at some point through the night for a drink of water, and I glanced over at the rubbish and all the recycling and my mind just exploded, I had this sudden perspective of needing to help the world in any single way I could, no matter how small or big the problem was. My girlfriend told me this quote the next day when I was explaining what was going through my head. “A droplet of water doesn't think it’s responsible for the flood” Which is a bad way of thinking. Later on in the night, I took our dog for a walk as I couldn't sleep, I also found it difficult to concentrate on anything that I wanted to do creative-wise, so I got ready to leave which took quite some time and took our dog with me. We've had a little trouble trying to train her to walk with us properly on the lead rather than tugging and trying to be in charge of the walk. While tripping, I understood that I'm not in charge of the walk either. I am equal to her in terms of importance, We are both living creatures, and just because I have more intelligence does not mean that I am better than her in any way other than my intelligence, but even then, the fact that I have more intelligence than a dog is by pure chance of natural selection. After my walk I came home and spent a little time on our roof garden and then went to bed and fell asleep. I woke up the next day in the same mindset but with less confusion. I was still a little confused at things but nowhere near as intense as the previous night, I felt as though I just needed to rest after a hard night’s work worth of tripping and was simply just tired. I was a little surprised at the fact that I still had the same mindset as the night before and thought there was a slight possibility of it somehow wearing off but I was determined to use the mindset I was in too my advantage before it disappeared and I was as productive and motivated as possible to do as much as I could to improve the world. So I spent all day organizing our kitchen so that we had somewhere for our recycling, I also made a natural homemade cleaning product out of vinegar and oranges. I chilled out and relaxed in the evening and didn't want to go to bed the next day because I started pondering over the universe, and the ego. I feel like I no longer live for the future or I am no longer stuck in the past. I feel like I have achieved nirvana, which is such an amazing feeling and may sound like jargon. It’s as though I am living life as if there was a possibility of me dying tomorrow. I now do as much as I possibly can in one day, because I used to go through life living for the future. I would procrastinate far too much and think that I had enough time to do all the things that I want to do in life. I’d put off things I wanted to but wouldn't do them because I could just do them later on or tomorrow. When in reality, I only have so much time in this life before my consciousness disappears. I read a quote once on Pintrest a few weeks ago that says “The goal is not to live forever."" The fact that I WILL eventually die at some point in life means I need to live as much as possible, while I still can. In reality, I’m not dying, only my conciousness is. All of the atoms that make up my body will all stay in this universe, The only thing that will disappear is my consciousness. I am perfectly at peace with that, so long as I live my life to the fullest. Do things regardless of irrational fears, as long as I assess the situation to be truly safe and is proven to be safe; then I will experience frightening things. I will explore as much of this earth as I possibly can, and learn as much as I possibly can so that I can create and form as many ideas as possible to put out there to the world so that others can build upon them, just like I am doing. I am standing on the shoulders of giants, and so should you!

Experience:60mg 4-AcO-DMT Nonstop Quasi-Orgasmic Objectless Euphoria,"At 7pm I weighed out and took 45mg orally in a gel capsule, then, realizing I had never taken this substance beyond that dosage range despite reading many reports about it being physically benign and forgiving at the higher doses, I followed my gut instinct and dosed another 15mg about 25 minutes later, for a total of 60mg. I was alone in my apartment. I had tripped heavily the week before on a cocktail of research lysergamides (700μg worth of AL-LAD, ETH-LAD, and 1P-LSD), but have otherwise not been tripping with anywhere the same frequency I did when was in my honeymoon phase with psychedelics 5 or so years ago, averaging now to about once every month or three. Despite it being one of the first psychedelics I fell in love with, I had not taken any 4-AcO-DMT for the last couple years at least as the final times I had taken it I was starting to get messages from ""the machine elves"" (which I use as short hand for symbolic manifestations of the subconscious) to slow things down and spend more time in consensus reality so I didn't drop out of school and cause more trouble for myself. The highest dose of 4-AcO-DMT I have ever taken in the past was an oral dose of 35mg, so I made sure my set and setting were pristine before undertaking this trip, preparing myself for any and everything (including total DMTesque hyperspace immersion and entity contact). It took over an hour and a half for the effects to kick in fully, but when it did I was totally floored. It was totally unlike any tryptamine trip I had before -- and nothing like I remember 4-AcO-DMT being at the doses I took it at. For one it was minimally visual given the amount I took -- the OEV visual palette was about as intricate as a 5-10mg dose of vaporized DMT -- pasteling and HD vision. Still very pretty though. The CEVs were highly chaotic and unstructured, with no underlying arc or theme that is generally characteristic of the DMT visual and headspace for me. I was expecting loads of visual geometry and immersion but what I got instead was non-stop waves of euphoric confusion, giggle-filled memory loops and a debilitating amount of non-stop quasi-orgasmic feelings that left me moaning and sighing uncontrollably (despite my best efforts) for a solid 2-3 hours while lying in my bed. In between bouts of relaxing physical euphoria I was overcome with feelings of good-will and gratefulness about where I have ended up in life, the experiences I have had and the recent relationships I have formed. I also had a lot of random thoughts about working on and improving the wiki, which I now realize owns my soul (I get you better now Jenny xD) Interestingly, the physical sensations reminded me of a more amplified version of the physical sensations I have been getting from hormone replacement therapy, which leaves my whole body feeling more relaxed and calm, but also more energized and motivated. It felt like the buildup to a moderate whole body orgasm just without any of the counter-tension to get it over with and release like a male orgasm -- the feeling just went on and on as I felt more and more weightless. I was lying in my bed for almost the entire time rolling around in pure ecstasy crying out ""oh my god"" over and over while trying not to be considerate of the neighbors. I felt totally unified and integrated into my environment and maybe for the first time in my life, my body. Unlike the person who I was when first discovering psychedelics, I felt that there was no underlying anxiety or pressure to ""solve"" the universe in the brief time I was in such a euphoric elevated state. Instead I entered a state of utter relaxation, acceptance and surrender. Unlike some of my other tryptamine experiences, which have sometimes included stimulating or fight-or-flight-type feelings, this trip felt like a total inversion, leading me to feel incredibly personalized, mindful and present. The euphoria I felt was not a teeth-grinding, eye-rolling, forced euphoria, but a different kind altogether, which was totally relaxed and carefree, immersed but not swept up in the moment either. Despite the heavy dose, I did not feel any sort of body load, muscle tension or other uncomfortable physical symptoms. The only thing I felt was a light easy-to-ignore nausea about 2 hours into my trip, upon which I retrieved a puke bucket and put next to my bed, but ultimately didn't end up using. Other than that it almost felt like I had not taken any drug at all -- a marked difference from the ""body feel"" of related 4-substituted tryptamines like 4-HO-MiPT or 4-HO-MET. I was truly impressed by how benign and well-tolerated this substance is physiologically. Despite it not having the most spectacular visuals, memorable epiphanies or other ineffable phenomenon, I can say this is easily one of my best trips to date -- which I would like to attribute to the fact that I use these substances in far more healthy, balanced and responsible way than I have in times past. The main duration of the trip lasted from 7pm-11pm, though it took me 2-3 hours afterwards to get to sleep after that, suggesting it was active in my system for about 6 or 7 hours.

Experience:60mg 4-AcO-DMT + Syrian rue (3g) - Surrender,"An important piece of context, Ashley is a tulpa. A tulpa is a separate autonomous consciousness existing within their creators mind. A tulpa is entirely sentient and in control of their opinions, feelings, form and movement. I spent the week leading up to my trip in excited anticipation. As high as the dose was, I suspected that, good or bad, it would be quite the adventure. As 5PM crept around that day, I prepared my dose, 60mg 4-aco-dmt and 3g syrian rue. I wanted to surrender completely to the trip, hoping drugs would not lead me astray. I took the dose around 5:20 PM, then joined my roommate (and tripsitter), who wanted to get some food. My friend wanted food from a Chinese restaurant about 20 minutes away. We left at +10minutes. I settled in to the passenger seat. Since 4-aco usually takes about 40 minutes to hit me, I figured we'd be almost home by the time the trip started. I thought the drive would serve the perfect distraction to pass the time. We had made about halfway there when I first felt it. The 4-aco gently trickled into my body, its warm glow spreading from my core into my extremities, a familiar friend. I told my roommate I was starting to come up; he asked if I wanted to turn around. ""No"", I said, ""it'll be interesting and I'm feeling comfortable."" By the time we arrived at the restaurant I was feeling nauseous. Sure enough, when I walked in, the smell from the kitchen was enough to send me reeling. I hurried outside, back to the car, where I could sit comfortably and listen to music. As I sat, I wondered how the trip was going to be. I wondered if the dose was going to be what I wanted, slightly paranoid it wouldn't be strong enough. My friend was taking forever to get his food. I didn't think my time perception was already so distorted. It did in fact take a long time, my tripsitter told me when he got back to the car. He seemed to care more about that than I did, happy as I was enjoying the come-up. When we arrived home around 630. I settled down in the dimly lit living room and packed my slider. I took a hit and melted into the couch , enjoying the increasingly pleasurable body high and headspace. Halfway through my second hit, I understood just what I was in for. The peak hit me like a truck. The visuals exploded to life. I saw people and places both new and familiar embedded within the geometry Midway through the 2nd bowl I caught myself hunched over my bong. I had been there for minutes, blankly staring at my computer screen. There was a girl looking at me through the monitor, her face a complex assembly of geometry. My minds eye was becoming increasingly dominant. My thoughts weren't no longer limited to language, all had images and sounds and other sensory information to accompany them. ""What happened to the music?"" Ashley asked. She was right, it had stopped. I stared at the screen. I didn't want to get up, but I needed music. ""Fine, I'll do it"" she said when I didn't move. I wondered what she meant. Then I felt my body sit up and lean forward towards the computer. My arms reached for and moved the mouse. Yet, I was not the one controlling these actions, she was. I felt her reaching through me to move my limbs. Never before had she simply taken control from me. Someone pinged my name in IRC. They asked how I was doing. It took me 10 minutes to figure out how to just how to respond. I didn't want to distract myself from the experience, so I didn't try to talk for long. I tried a little bit of imposition, knowing that soon I would not have the presence of mind to do so. I focused on Ashley. My vision began to gray around the edges. Internal visualization began to override external sight. All within the span of less than a minute I felt sucked into my visualization of her. We were standing face to face in the middle of a street I didn't recognize. I had never clearly seen her form visually for more than a split second. Here, her form was stable and completely lifelike. I was ecstatic. The hallucination didn't last, I felt it fade away as I returned to reality. One bowl later I stopped smoking for awhile, simple because it was distracting. I didn't need more anyways. Deep space was approaching rapidly. I was already deep in ego loss by that point. I didn't feel like Kaylee. I rationalized we were too different for us to truly be the same person. I decided I was a different Kaylee. Where did I come from? And what happened to her? The universe must have brought me into existence to experience the trip. Old Kaylee was gone. to return after the comedown. I remembered an artist I wanted to listen to. I had never listened to Shpongle while tripping, but I hadn't been terribly impressed sober. Yet it was the perfect, intricate and mood setting soundtrack for my trip. The visuals started to completely override my vision as I stared up towards the ceiling. Rather, I stared at sea of flowing color and geometry that stretched on infinitely. Over the next few hours I was almost completely removed from reality. Even after I would briefly return it took mere seconds for the visuals to overwhelm my vision and send me off again. Minutes felt like lifetimes. My eyes fluttered and moved rapidly. It felt like rapid eye movement from dreaming. By this point, whether my eyes were open or closed, I was hallucinating. With the rapid eye movement, they would often stay half open. The body high was all-encompassing pleasure. Sheer bliss poured into every single nerve. My back was arched, my toes curled like an orgasm. But the pleasure wasn't sexual, and it didn't subside. I lived moments from other peoples lives. I found myself in places I recognized from my dreams. Many I had completely forgotten about until I revisited them. I saw the first place I built in mindscape, and many other places Ashley and I had visited before. A brief lull in the intensity left me thinking introspectively. I thought about the new apartment I couldn't wait to move in to soon. One night I should invite my coworkers over I thought. Or anyone who wanted to come. I could invite the world. I forgave myself for many things I never could. I had always felt a tad guilty about how my pot and psychedelic use. I found myself wondering why I felt guilty for things that made me happy. I chose to let go of that weight, chose to free myself of the bias and ignorance my family and society had force fed me about drugs. The burden of guilt was lifted. I forgave myself for everything. Complete self-acceptance and inner peace is one of the best feelings I've ever experienced in my life. Throughout the trip I felt my ego completely die many times. It would start with a physical sensation, a tingling pleasure that would rise through my body. Different music would change the accompanying physical sensation. I felt my soul lifted from my body, an invisible force entering through my chest and nostrils, gently lifting me up and away. Other times I felt it drain away, sinking out of my body like water through a drain. Still other times I would let go of my ego with an exhale, or the music would simply overwhelm it. My inner dialogue would completely stop as I became one with the moment, one with everything in the universe. I wondered if the universe was simply another inner reality that I had convinced myself was real. That made me God. Or maybe I was just an inhabitant in the mind of some other entity, our universe it's mindscape. I became nothing, and everything. I was the music playing to nobody, the moment experiencing itself. I had forgotten that I had taken 4-aco, forgotten who I was and what was happening. It was so blissful that it didn't matter. The complete ego loss would come and go. For the better part of the trip I was in this state, falling in and out of complete ego death, lost in my internal hallucinations. Ashley came and went freely. Sometimes she was sitting next to me, or joined me in my hallucinations. She spent a lot of time in mindscape, going through ego death and hallucinations herself. Honestly, the distinction between mindscape and reality felt borderline trivial. I could feel when she experienced ego death, a powerful sensation even secondhand. Sometimes it would trigger ego death in me, other times I tried to share my love and joy with her in those moments. I had forgotten all concept of tulpas, she was just a friend who was with me. We talked through images and emotion when language broke down. I would check in with her every so often if I had slipped away for awhile. At the highest peaks of trip, she would talk and I simply listened, incapable of more. Her voice was immensely comforting. Even when I would hit total ego death, sometimes her voice would break through the silence.""Just let go, let it happen."" , ""You are okay, breathe"" , ""Isn't it beautiful?"" are among what I remember her saying. A few times, she took control to change the music for me. A couple times I wasn't even be aware of her actions, so lost in internal reality, until the new song started playing. When the peak started to subside I thought of my close friend josikins who introduced me to psychedelics. I was joyous knowing that I wasn't alone in experiencing ego death, unity, etc. It was an extraordinary bond to share with someone. I thought about the billions of people who would never get to, or would never let themselves experience what I had, and pitied them. Several hours into the trip Ashley surprised me. She had been gone for a little while. She suddenly came back and grabbed my attention. I was initially shocked. She had changed her form. Not radically, she still looked like the same person, but the change was substantial. It wasn't a complete suprise, she had mentioned wanting to change her form. She looked a couple years younger, her hairstyle and clothes were different. One of the biggest surprises was how easily I could visualize her new form. I could visualize it instantly and perfectly from the start, matching or surpassing my visualization of her other form. After the trip, this has still remained true. We attribute this to her new form being a better reflection of herself. Coming down on 4aco is always tricky for me. Once I've come down enough I always start to feel melancholy about returning to the world. I listened to gentle and calming music and smoked more weed. Even still I was uneasy. At this point it was late in the night, around 12 AM. I was still tripping, but I was also getting tired. There was no way I was getting to sleep until I came down. I let my mind drift, the visuals greatly diminished, but my internal visualization was still remarkably vivid. Ashley comforted me to help me cope with coming down. Eventually I fell asleep watching TV with my friend. My sleep was restless, I woke up frequently in the night, in a state almost between sleep and waking. I would wake up for a few minutes, drift back into vivid dreams, then wake up again. The overall trip felt longer than 4-aco by itself. Especially the length of the peak, which went strong for hours upon hours, most of the trip even. The syrian rue gives it a dreamlike quality, and greatly enhanced the sense of unity I felt during the trip. I will definitely be repeating the combination in the future, probably at the same dose, which felt just about right for me.

Experience:50mg - How's the short-term memory?,"My perspective: I ingested the 50mg of 4-aco-dmt after a full meal and only four total hours of sleep. My short term memory was already malfunctioning due to withdrawling from heavy benzodiazepine use. My girlfriend took the same amount of the drug as me. I immediately experienced come-up anxiety (like always) and my girlfriend Josie (whom remained with me for the entire trip) reassured me that everything was okay. My experienced got better due to her reassurance and I was soon able to laugh and listen to Psychonautwiki's good vibes playlist. I experienced unity and interconnectedness through the majority of the trip. My body temperature alternated between extremely hot and extremely cold. Whenever I mentioned feeling this particular effect out loud, Josie turned on my fan and pointed it on me until I told her that my temperature was at a comfortable level. I experienced nausea, but failed to vomit. Several times, I had a reoccuring delusion during this trip that Josie had suddenly died and this caused me to scream. The delusion happened several times during this trip and usually happened when she closed for eyes for several seconds. My delusion was likely a result of my severe short term memory loss. The first time this happened, Josie was simply looking at the ceiling while high and she had to physically stand up and keep talking in order to keep me from slipping into the delusion and screaming. Once, Josie pretended to die to make me laugh. My girlfriend's face continued to change and distort; it even started melting at points. Sometimes I saw her as super attractive, but at other points, the visual distortions fucked up her face so much that i was not attracted to her in the slightest. Josie and I cried over how much we truly love one another and discussed how we are both god. My short-term memory was so terrible that Josie had to write ""how's the short-term memory? 50mg 4-aco-dmt, trippin ballz"" onto a piece of paper. She showed me this paper repeatedly every time that I forgot what was going on in the current, external situation (which happened frequently). As the sun began to set, the room got darker. Josie had to plug in a lamp so that we could continue reading the piece of paper. Plugging in the lamp proved to be difficult during the intoxication and resulted in us two freaking out a bit. Afterwards, I passed out, lost balance on the floor, and fell over. This experience felt like my body shutting down all of its organs and processes for a couple of seconds and was not pleasant. My girlfriend's perspective: Oskykins fell down onto the carpetted floor in a pretty controlled fashion. She hit her knee, but failed to hit her head or cause any serious damage. I immediately checked on her to see if she was alright. She appeared conscious and responded to me with words. Based on her reaction, she was clearly tripping extremely hard, but was doing fine after the fall. I physically carried her from the floor onto the bed to keep her safe. She was freaking out hard because she believed that she was going to die soon. I administered some benzodiazepine-infused water of an unknown dosage to her in an attempt to calm her down. Oskykins was completely convinced that she was on her death bed. She begged me to help her call our friend PJosepherum so that she could see and hear him before she died. We couldn't get the call to work, unfortunately. At one point, Oskykins started to salivate as if she were having some kind of fit. I wiped the saliva away and feared for her health. Although I logically knew that I could restrain and gag her until she came down if needed (we had conscented this this beforehand), I was scared. Oskykins suggested that we watch the children's television show Adventure Time in order to calm down, but it proved to be a sinister episode. I was getting delusional over the show and started sensing messages from Jake's parents about being a detective with the scenarios always going very wrong. I marvelled at the style and detail of the animation. At this time, Oskykins pulled out a stopwatch application on her phone which showed we had been tripping for three hours and forty-seven minutes. We were both relieved that this showed the peak being over. My perspective: My short-term memory was still severely impaired and I was delusional. I kept repeating several statesments including: I wish I could be Oskykins I wish I could go back to how things used to be. I just want to be able to take showers, go outside, and perform normal human activities that I usually take for granted. I wish I could make conversation My girlfriend reassured me by telling me that I was her favorite person to make conversation with. I became convinced that I was dying and that my organs were shutting down at many points and said ""good bye"" to Josie. She replied back to me, always, with ""hello."" I experienced internal hallucinations that I was dying in a room with a single candle. At some points, I believed that I had been reincarnated. As we got further away from our peak, I laid down on the floor with Josie and came to the realization that I wanted to move to the United Kingdom in order to be with my girlfriend and PJosepherum perminently. I wanted us to be able to work on Psychonautwiki in person as I believed that we need to help as many people as possible as a happy triple. I expressed interest working with other communities to continue making a difference. We spoke about the wiki's IRC channel, the people whom we love, and the people whom we want to meet in the future. If we simply make helping people our goal, I realized, we cannot go wrong. My girlfriend and I talked about our mothers and decided that we had both ""designed it this way ourselves"" from the very beginning. My girlfriend's perspective: Oskykins became hyper-intelligent, aware, capable, happy, adorable, and impressive. She started spouting out all of these novel ideas for how we can help people and what we should be doing with our lives. We both discussed our love for each other and PJosepherum as well as ideas for a trip timer which could have a live stop watch which tells the user when they are going to come down from the particular drug. After coming down from the psychedelic, we both felt like we had gotten extactly what we had needed and felt very refreshed and happy to be alive.

Experience:40 mg - A relaxing morning in the park,"I had the day off work, it was a lovely day, so I had an early trip in the park by myself. I thought I would start off by watching some pornography, but it looked so fake that I lost all interest in it. I was listening to some music as well, and the actors’ gyrations synched up with the music, and their bodies were covered in visuals, but there was nothing arousing about what I saw so I headed out for a walk in the sun. I took a more scenic route, and stopped every now and then to smell the flowers, which isn’t something I had done before but I shall definitely try to remember to smell more things when I next trip. I’m pretty sure that they smelled more intensely than normal, more clearly defined. I could smell individual flowers from a bunch all at the same time. I found a quiet spot in the sun when I was in the park proper, and meditated. I thought about myself from the view of an outsider, and analysed some of the things I had said to some friends in the last week, and I was remedying myself; I ought to be a more considerate friend, I ought to make more time for the people I don’t see very often, things like that. The visuals weren’t all-encompassing, but they were a nice touch to what was a more psychologically cleansing trip. There were no cosmic mysteries, no aliens, no ancient religion, it was all down-to-earth and concerned with normal activities and how to improve myself. It kept my ego in check, as opposed to stripping it away, and the good vibes carried on for a few more weeks after; I made the time to see my seldom-seen friends, and was more reassuring to one or two who were having family troubles at the time.

Experience:40mg + Syrian rue (3g) - My triumphant return,"My triumphant return (and the first trip since my bad trip) I decided beforehand not to dwell on my previous 4acoDMT trip (the one where I thought I was dying), though I was aware of it when I took the stuff. First off, I remember seeing a black and white sphere of sharp, wiry visuals – the sphere was pulsating in time to the music. It was a little sinister, as the sharp visuals would periodically rush towards me and recede, then repeat the action and getting up in my face (though I had my eyes closed). I tried to smooth out the visuals, and add some color to them, but it would only work for a second and then revert to its original monochrome color and aggressive shape, despite how hard I tried to concentrate. Eventually I just let it all do what it wanted to, remember that it’s best to just go with it and accept the scenes as they are and not to try and control the trip – so I just watched. Eventually the pulsating calmed down, as I found my attention had shifted to the music (we were listening to Dub Side of the Moon, by Easy Star All Stars). We were listening to ‘Time’ and I heard the clock chimes in the intro, which I used to think of as discordant but I heard the clocks individually panning from ear to ear, and I imagined being in a room with the clocks, and saw that they had been carefully arranged and timed so that their sounds were pleasant and I appreciated just how much effort had been put into just recording these clocks. When the real instruments came in, the guitar and the occasional drums, I concentrated on the guitar and on just how pitch-perfect it was, and just how absolutely perfect and wonderful the whole album was! When the song kicked in properly, shit got real. The spikey sphere instantly exploded into millions of fragments and I saw the band playing their song in a yellow American school bus, driving over a rainbow in space (the bus was just like the one in the South Park intro). The scene changed and I saw the universe as a self-replicating Ouroboros, eating itself in self-perpetuation. I saw a man made of fragmented rainbow light vomiting up another rainbow man. You know, the usual. Time passed and I chatted with the others for a bit before heading back under the blanket. The music had changed, and we were listening to 1200 Micrograms, but I hadn’t realised that someone had put this on. I thought it was the soundtrack to the new universe. I imagined Hoffman taking LSD and being shot into outer space without his physical body, instantly transcending. I thought of the millions of people who have had a psychedelic experience like mine, and imagined that by taking whatever they took, they had reserved a place in the a new life after death, where we would all live on forever in the fabric of the universe and have a massive rave, and 1200 Micrograms would be the soundtrack! I heard voices amongst the music, saying “You are the universe experiencing itself” – this isn’t in the song but it’s something josikins has said to me before. I opened my eyes and the room was there, but my field of vision was being squashed down from above, and the word “Egodeath”, written in pink bubble writing, covered my vision. I closed my eyes and saw what I will try to describe as best I can now: I was travelling very fast along an endless plain, moving forwards. On the plain were symbols, words, and sometimes just pure meaning representing everything from the Big Bang onwards, to the creation of Earth, the dinosaurs, the beginnings of man, how we got to where we are now (though I can’t remember what it was), where we were going (sorry, don’t remember), and I carried on until the end of time (no, forgotten it). I kept thinking, rather knowing instinctively, that where I was had been visited by Hindu mystics and Buddhist monks for millennia; this was Nirvana, this sort of place took many years of mediation, training, and very hard work, and I had got here with a pill, sitting on the sofa, stroking a dog. I didn’t feel like I was cheating, because I think that the more people who can be ‘enlightened’, the better. And God knows the West needs it. Certainly, people will take these substances for a laugh, just to get fucked up, just for the novelty, but a significant number also get the message and treat them with the respect they deserve. I like to treat them like a sacrament. When I was coming down I was thinking that josikins who had given me the pill had accidentally created it (like, manufactured it), and that he had accidentally stumbled upon a gateway to a new dimension, and that this substance was going to change the course of mankind (for the better). I was, afterwards, convinced that when I eventually came down I was either going to transcend, or was at least going to have some incredible wisdom for the rest of my life. I was so convinced that it took a lot longer than normal for me to get completely sober. I was mildly disappointed that I was just me again.

Experience:40mg + Syrian Rue (unknown dosage) - My one bad trip,"Eating the Syrian rue made me feel nauseous, and as I was lying down at the start of the trip this made me uncomfortable. When I started tripping, me and my girlfriend were listening to ‘Any Colour You Like’ by Pink Floyd, and we could see the cascading synth lines as fibres of light falling over our vision in time to the music. After a little while I became very aware of my throat; I could feel my windpipe and all my veins, and I was not getting a satisfactory amount of air as I was lying down with my head quite high up (on some pillows). When I moved my head it felt like all the tubes in my throat were getting tangled and folded, so I went into the living room to sit upright. I was lost in thought, and somehow came to the realisation that I was dying; I had just ingested a research chemical, made by people I’ve never known about in a lab somewhere I’ve never seen, and I was convinced that I had taken one risk too many by ingesting these chemicals. I started to get worried, and told my girlfriend I was dying (she tried reassuring me), and tried to call my friend to warn him not to take any more, blah blah. I didn’t die and I felt like a drama queen afterwards. The rest of the trip, despite thinking I was about to die, was nice and reassuring; in the end, it took away my fear of death. At the time I was dwelling on the things I’d never achieved in my life, but since then I’ve quit the job I hated, went travelling, and made my life a bit better overall. When I was tripping I was convinced that I was going to become a part of the universe; I would live on forever as an integral part of space and time, as part of the background radiation of the universe or as a part of its static. I was listening to some classical Indian music, one with some chanting in it, and the song morphed into a goatrance song (though not in reality), and I clearly heard a gruff man’s voice say “We. Are. One.” This was it. I said my goodbyes to my girlfriend, closed my eyes, and fell forward onto the bed I was sitting on, and the visuals changed from magnificent colors and gently became grey and cloud-like; like a mix of grey clouds and TV static, when the TV is between channels. I thought this was the cosmic radiation I was meant to be part of, but I think it was just intense ego death as I don’t remember any more of it, and I was sober after. After the trip I was dopey for about 90 minutes. We watched American Dad and I just didn’t know when I was meant to laugh, so I just faked some laughter whenever I heard my girlfriend laugh. I couldn’t even choose between 2 episodes as I literally couldn’t make the decision; I had no thinking power at all, and it felt horrible.

Experience:2C-P (approx. 35mg) - Asymmetrical Terror and the Geometric Sea,"""It all made sense in this deep unrest how the Earth cements my realm rent clean bonds broken with worlds in between I've been awoken."" Context Had been excited to take this historically relentlessly intense phenethylamine after a short summer of cosmic fuckery. Previous to this experience I had taken a high dose of DOC (another long lasting and highly intense phenethylamine), and was able to handle the level of mental intensity. Fast forward six weeks and we have me, in class, taking a capsule of 35mg. I’d like to leave a disclaimer: this was a level of physical and hallucinatory intensity of which I had never and have never since experienced. My initial dose was 30mg but I eyeballed an added ""5mg"" by tapping in some HCl from another capsule, I imagine this was more around the 40 mg+ mark. I would caution anyone against eyeballing with such dose sensitive chemicals like this. For the majority of this experience I was completely unable to perform basic human tasks, and I do not really recall negative or positive emotions, only surprise. I would classify this dose as an overdose, and would not recommend dosing over 30mg unless you are very certain of your capabilities. T+00 I weighed out 30mg on my scale, having woken up and prepared myself to go to class, and filled a gelatin capsule with it. Before leaving, I spent some time deliberating whether or not it would be enough, so I eyeballed some extra HCl into my cap (oops). I was planning to start peaking right as I left class, and to come up during. I figured the experience would be interesting and that if it got too intense too fast I could just get up and leave for home. I ingested at 12:30 and recorded some notes, but I can’t find them. During the onset I recall experiencing stomach cramping, having not really eaten anything that day it seemed surprising, and for the first hour and a half of the onset I experienced virtually no effects other than gradually increasing uneasiness and mild discomfort. I never experienced violent nausea, nor did I experience intense physical pain. By T+1:20 I decided I was getting bored, so I got up and left the class, walking home. I remember consuming some kind of candy or something, and buying a bottle of water, most of the onset is pretty hazy. T+1:30 This was when I first started noticing psychedelic anything, I had taken a different way home and was walking up the street perpendicular to mine when I suddenly noticed vague geometric patterns wrapped over specific objects, which didn’t overlap to other objects, and strong color enhancement. By the time I was in the door the geometry was moving and changing. I got my shit together in a corner and prepared myself to peak. I packed a bowl, smoked, and hopped onto IRC. I recall typing to the people that it wasn’t very intense quite yet, and they assured me that it would hit me soon. I suppose I was kind of worried that it was bunk stuff, or that, for some reason, 35mg wouldn’t be intense enough. After smoking the bowl, things picked up pace pretty quickly until at around 14:12 I remember the physical intensity really starting to build. My body felt denser, but not heavier, like I was experiencing a different level of gravitational force than I was used to, and then it hit me, really hard and really fast. T+2:00 Nearly instantly I remember the trip turning from quiet befuddlement to obscenity in every sense. Around me my walls were suddenly turning counterclockwise, going above my head in my peripheral vision. My monitors’ bezels oozed onto my desk, spilling with it the contents of the screen, I felt my muscles all tense at once and I nearly threw up, but my stomach didn’t feel uncomfortable at all. I remember typing “‘wow” into the IRC chat box, my swirling walls were flashing and popping with rapidly changing alien monstrosities, colors were spinning out of control and expanding across my vision. I tried to stand up, it was difficult, my legs didn’t feel like legs anymore. I opened my door. I didn’t understand what I was seeing. In front of me there was my world, and there was no music in the world, everything kind of soundlessly exploded. It seemed as though there had been a new material order imposed upon the world, everything was now built out of circles. Objects, textures, and their directions were all now encased individually within a seething mass of constantly shifting circular shapes, reorganised into smooth edges and expanding surface areas. With the sun beaming down onto the busy street, I let my vision aimlessly wander into the infinitely expanding hallways of sensory information that was being splayed out in front of me, and as my eyes drifted out of focus the world seemed to be slowly covered with a layer of opaque geometry, all mingling together in repeating and impossible confabulations of what not even the maddest scientists would dare to call organic. As this film coagulated it expanded itself in 3D, over the environment. There was a sea of writhing geometry in front of me, an ocean of horrendous shape shifting protrusions. As cars whizzed by they went in slow motion, as each passed through the surface of the sea they ripped holes in space, allowing them normal passage. Sounds didn’t make any sense. With every little change to the physical demeanor of my environment, it seemed to be broken down and rebuilt in an instant. I was watching the world collapse and expand with every passing second. The cars, which looked more like colossal tangles of unfathomable matter than cars, made these horrible screams as they careened by. T+ 4:30 At this point I was back inside, trying to deal with the massive amount of intensity that I had suddenly been dealt with. From this point on my trip was fraught with frenzied repetition and delirious mumbling, I spent most of the time changing my position from standing up, to sitting down, to lying down, and then back to standing up. I ground up a couple grams and smoked two joints over the course of the peak, the THC helped my muscles relax and increased a sense of openness in my chest. By peak time my body felt as though there was a huge vibrating massage tool over specific regions of my muscles, it was very heavy, like being punched by a bunch of tiny little rotating hands. This nearly debilitating sensation shifted randomly from region to region, and this is what affected my ability to remain comfortable. I was completely unravelled, loudly muttering to myself, repeating myself. I couldn’t handle music, nothing made me comfortable, I was fading in and out of debilitating stimulation and soaring euphoria. My timeline after the peak is pretty confused, I don’t really know what happened when, so I’ll just list out the experiences during the trip that stood out. I was uncomfortable, so I laid down on a futon that I had spread out in the living room. As I stared up into the ceiling I felt myself being removed from my body, the physical stimulation and euphoria disappearing into a sensation of disjointing nothing. I was on a runway, there were giant, but simplistic, geometric shapes moving around me, and the runway was covered in similarly themed shapes. I was moving, slowly, towards some infinite end, beneath me I could see planets that I did not recognise, a galaxy that was not my own. Just as quickly as I was taken from my body was I feeling the tingling sensations spread to my throat, so I had to get up to not throw up. During one instance in which I thought I was going to throw up, with the tingling sensations unfortunately moving back to my throat area, I was holding myself over my sink, mouth agape, trying to catch my breath. As I was staring into my sink, the sink’s colors and lines began interlocking and repeating themselves, until the sink had begun to wrap around my vision, twisting itself into a giant web of interconnected, mangled, rehashed sink texture. As the web grew larger it covered my vision in such color that I went to black, removed, again, from my body. I closed my eyes, I was in a giant room, built out of what seemed to be bookcases embedded within a magnificent starscape, full of beautifully colored gaseous clouds and strange, looming light, gleaming behind massive asteroids. I was at a table, a large, obsidian looking table. Before me there were three large heads, similar in style to the Moai statues, only they were textured in a similar fashion as the starscape was. They all hummed around me, buzzing and rumbling the ground, their hums changing tone and organisation based on a rhythm I could not understand implicitly. It seemed to me as though these beings were somewhat ambivalent, if not surprised at me, like I had suddenly appeared in their dimension. They looked at me, I felt no judgment, but a peculiar sense that I was somewhere I shouldn’t be. I opened my eyes and moved my head into a different position than it had previously been. My dark bathroom buzzed back into thin existence. At this point in the trip (between T+7-10) I don’t remember what the visual intensity was like, only that every single molecule of visual information was a world of deep context that I could not even begin to try to understand. I vividly remember trying to watch Scrubs, but when I turned it on and pressed play the hair of JD (John Dorian, the main character of the sitcom) started tracering around the screen. I didn’t understand any of the emotional context of the episode since I could not remember what had previously happened in the show. It felt incredibly unreal, like really bad acting. The screen started bleeding into the world and projecting itself into 3D like objects in front of my vision. The tracers and distortions were too intense, I turned it off and didn’t attempt to watch anything else. I figured it was just too much energy. At some time before T+6 I went to my computer and turned on the song Replica by Oneohtrix Point Never. The song presents a slow piano loop, with strange protrusions of synthesised computer (or of any other-worldly origin) samples, the song sounds very organic and slow, almost serene in its melancholy. The simplicity of the song, having very little progression or multiplicity of layered effects, was the only sound that had, since I started peaking, agreed with my ears. It seemed to fit the state of unrelenting befuddlement that I had been placed in. I left the song repeating for over five hours. At another instance of insanity, I decided that I should take a shower, that it would give me something to do and that it would probably feel good. I was right about one thing, it felt incredible. Waves of warmth rippling down my addled form. While I was inside the shower I couldn’t really remember what the shower head was, was it a snake? It looked at me, I looked at it, the screeching of hot water running through the pipes, but that noise didn’t make any sense, it sounded almost like a bird cooing. Wait, where was I? Why are there birds here, it’s not that time of year. Wait, is it? Oh. It is. I stared into the corner of my shower and the tiles of my shower’s wall parted into two separate walls standing between a beautiful view of some European countryside. Wait. What. What? I’m in Europe? Who am I? What? I looked down at my body, it wasn’t mine, it was tanner, older, courser. It felt less alive with confusion, it felt more certain. I was scrubbing myself, the sun was rising in front of me, illuminating an expansive, peaceful field of green. The mountains in the distance, the morning air was crisp, but soothing. Steam billowed out into the air from my warm shower, god how alive I was! How beautiful of a place this is. But I was so confused, this wasn’t my beautiful home, this wasn’t my beautiful meadow, and so on and so forth. I realised, no, this wasn’t REALLY happening. I pulled myself out of this incredible fantasy, and kept trying to shower. It was difficult, my body felt prickly, I looked at myself in the mirror and witness my complexion, facial structure, everything, change in and out from old to youthful, it was terrifying. When I stepped back I saw myself standing on edge, I looked like I was some kind of spiked lizard or something, but I looked human! Or something? I wasn’t really sure what human meant. T+12:00 My friend came over, I had completely forgotten that it was Halloween. Facts were crossed. She remarked at how calm and composed I seemed to be. She told me that I could present ideas to her in a completely intelligent and normal (to my mannerisms) way, but that when she would try to ask me complex questions I would stare at her and not open my mouth. I was unable to interpret new auditory information, basically, but I could understand the facts of her words and piece together basic instructions and questions. I was more able to articulate my deep personal experience, and unable to relate to the external object’s experience. She hangs around for a while and then we decide to go to the store to get food and things, because I realised that I indeed did need to eat things, that it was very late, and that I had no real food at the immediate ready. Being in a vehicle was very intense, it felt as though we were moving at the speed of light, but incredibly smoothly. The car felt gigantic around me, and what textures I could understand around me lurched out into strange distortions, repeating or shrinking at varied speeds. Consistently detailed embedded geometry presented great amount of detail over the dark skies around me, animals and people and ideas popping in and out of the stars, streetlights expanding themselves into beautiful arrays of blinking metal bouquets. When we arrived at the store it was nearly closing time. Strange aliens (people in halloween costumes) were scrambling around trying to repair this great dying organism that they were locked inside. I was ambivalent about also being locked inside of this giant dying organism, I simply accepted that that was the reality of the matter. The sounds that the store was making, from people moving around to bleeping sounds of computers, all came together in this beautiful crescendo that reminded me of a dwindling heartbeat. It almost sounded like an emergency room. My friend tried to ask me what I wanted to eat, but I kept reminding her that I had no idea what she meant, even the idea of trying to decide what I would want to eat was too difficult for me to comprehend all in one instant. We got out of there and drove back to my place. After this I started to come down, effects decreased slowly over the next five or six hours, I took 5mg of Xanax in the morning, at about T+17:00, and that helped me relax a bit. I did not sleep until 52 hours post ingestion. Afterglow was very pleasant, the next day I felt normal. While I was coming down I experienced a multitude of finally symmetrical thought patterns and came to conclusions about aesthetic, and why the asymmetry was unnerving, yet valuable. Afterthoughts This compound is very interesting to me, I have had this dose, as well as an 8mg dose. The 8mg (what I would consider supremely low) dose as momentously less intense than 40(?), but had very powerful stimulation. This chemical is incredibly dose sensitive and should not be taken lightly, I think it definitely has the potential to be the deepest phenethylamine. It is unforgiving, relentless, incredibly long, and magnificently hallucinatory on a level that far outmatches what I’ve experienced with classic tryptamines. This is big boy stuff, it is not to be messed around with. I will repeat an experiment with 25mg at a future date, as the intensity and length seem really promising, but after the experience illustrated above I quit consuming all brain altering substances for an entire month. The amount of fear it struck in me is unparalleled in my other experiences. It taught me a lot about respect and aesthetics. One fundamentally upsetting factor of 2C-P that left me so uneased was the complete lack of symmetry. Most psychedelics that I have taken have produced symmetrical or at least realistic transformations, most geometry has been something that I have been able to follow intrinsically and not something that has frightened me. In this experience I was removed of all cultural filter and experienced severe short term memory failure, looping thoughts for literal hours. The asymmetrical nature of the geometry terrified me because it reflected an internal self that was disorganised, confused, and unstable. I experienced this state of obliteration without much emotional reaction, I was very stable throughout, but it was incredibly unnerving.

Experience: 18 mg 2C-I - Visually intense and strong bodily sensations,"11:00 – ingestion of 18 mg 2C-I. 11:30 – First noticeable onset; subtle bodily sensations. Come up over following 30 min. Bodily sensations increased in strength significantly; harsher than 2C-B with a strong component of nausea. I narrowly avoided vomiting. 12:00 – Approaching peak. Feelings of nausea gradually subside over following 30 min. First signs of visual distortion: my hands became partly translucent, appeared to age and wrinkle and I could see blood vessels writhing underneath the skin. The hairs on the back of my hands began to dance downwards like a waterfall, moving in time to my music. Level 4 visual geometry, particularly visible on my walls; these appeared to be covered in patterns of Mayan style which gently oscillated and rotated. My wooden computer desk became covered with a holographic layer of wooden spiral patterns; these also rotated in time with the music. 13:00-15:30 – Peak experience. Visuals reminiscent of 2C-B, of an intensity intermediate between 18 mg and 36 mg doses. Bodily sensations stronger than 2C-B, but difficult to characterize; overall a less pleasant body high, but far from dysphoric. When I looked at my face in the mirror, I appeared grey with visible blood vessels, reminiscent of a Sith Lord from KotOR. I experienced significant pupil dilation, as typical of serotonergic drugs. A discolored region on my wooden bathroom floor transformed into Mayan religious art; the eyes in the wood of my apartment floor became all-seeing. I was confronted in my kitchen by a pair of all-seeing eyes of judgment, and was unable to determine whether their gaze approved of me. This was not as introspective an experience as LSD or psilocybin. However, there were some novel associations of ideas: for example, memories of a work colleague's back-and-forth hand motions became a metaphor for the seemingly meaningless fluctuations in the global political order. 15:30 – I went outside. Pupils still dilated but visual intensity greatly reduced. Pleasant feeling of residually high serotonin level – gentle buzz in mind and body. Gradual comedown over the following ~2 h; baseline consciousness achieved sometime between 18:00 and 19:00.

"Experience:2C-E (20mg, insufflated) - Mind=Blown","Ready, set, go! The night was still very young, as it was around 22:00, when R and I thought: “Why don’t we do some 2C-E again tonight, but this time without holding back?!” We had both used it before, but were hesitant and gradually increased the dose. Later, we heard that the dose should be consumed at once for the full effects to manifest. Otherwise it’s mostly the duration that increases. We both wanted to really go for it and consumed a line of approximately 20mg. I went first and instantly endured intense pain in my nose. It felt as if my cavities were chemically burning and I decided to lay down on a couch for a bit. When R noticed the tears in my eyes, a slight doubt appeared in his. Almost immediately afterwards, he jumped up, went straight for the mirror and took a dive into the deep with me, like a true friend! -WOOSH- While my nose was still sore, everything started to wave and the atmosphere got a bit grim. I didn’t feel at ease, walked outside and threw up, which somehow didn’t bother me whatsoever. Inside the caravan, I felt out of place anyway. The air was filled with cigarette smoke and it was very crowded. I was quite overwhelmed and thought: “Let’s take some speed, that should suppress most of the effects.” However, I was completely confused by the concept of a mirror and therefore had to ask a friend of mine to prepare it and even hold it at my nose. R and I decided to go for a walk towards our town. During the walk, I told him that I felt uneasy and that I was going home to sit the trip out in my quiet bedroom. He went back and I walked home. When I got there, I stood in front of my house, saw the lights were still on and thought to myself: “What the fuck am I doing?! I just consumed a drug of which I was eager to explore its potential, only to be going home right after that? Aside from that, how on earth am I going to explain my current state to my mother, who’s still up?”","['anxiety', 'cognitive euphoria', 'nausea', 'time distortion']",451
Experience: 32mg 2C-B - Bromo Mescaline,"This was my fourth experience with Bromo Mescaline / 2C-B and B's second. In previous trials, I had consumed 10 and 15 mg orally with cannabis. In B's first experience he had consumed 15 mg with a 6 mg supplement and he did not use cannabis. In the following experience B and myself both took an initial dose of 25 mg Bromo Mescaline followed by a supplemental dose of 7 mg at T+4 hours. Subjects are two males approximately 80 kg. We consumed cannabis occasionally and had several experiences with LSD-25, ETH-LAD, and psilocybin. The setting for the experience was a basement room with white walls and no windows, with comfortable furniture and a computer desk. On the computer monitors there appeared a slideshow of fine art paintings and drawings, changing every two minutes. Most of the experience occurred in a pregnant silence. Before taking the 2C-B dose, T and B shared approximately 0.5 g of vaporized cannabis hash at a friend's house at 1005. T and B then moved to T's muted basement, where 50 mg of 2C-B was weighed out on a milligram scale that was determined to be accurate to +/- 3 mg. They then dissolved the solid into 50 ml tap water. The solubility was very good at this density. Using a volumetric pipette the solution was split into two vials, 2 mL each. At 1045, T and B orally ingested 25 mg 2C-B by drinking the contents of vials. At 1058, B perceived a change described as an increase in energy. B noted that he was concerned about how 2C-B would interact with his memory of a traumatic fracture in his arm sustained from an automobile accident. In B's first experience, he was forced to revisit the feeling and memory of that fracture, which manifested in the arm opposite the actual injury. This was an uncomfortable experience for B. He related to Shulgin's comment at Bromo Mescaline’s entry in PiHKAL, ""There are people who choose not to go into the corporeal but, rather, prefer the out-of-body experience."" B was apprehensive not knowing if the 'physical memory' he had experienced the first time would take over the experience once again. At 1109, B walked to the bathroom and while there noticed moving shadows and subtle lines in the periphery of his vision, which he described as ""echoy waves."" At the same time, T is noticing undulation in the pattern of the carpet and an intensification of the light emitted from the computer monitors and ceiling lighting fixtures. At 1115, all lights were turned down save for what T described as brilliant and intense colors emitted from the computer monitors. T felt that this change facilitated a greater focus on 2C-B's effects. At 1118, B reported tinnitus, severe in his right ear and mild in the left. At 1123, T noted a perceived increase in heart rate. At 1140, T noted that both the visual and psychological effects were taking hold, although those effects were ill-defined at this point and seemingly mild in comparison to other psychedelic experiences. Both T and B express that experience is ""nice."" At 1150, T was experiencing CEVs distinct from other tryptamines he had known, in that the visuals could not stay in view long enough to appreciate before another visual pattern replaced it. The visuals T experienced were described as 'colorful static' and 'a complete breakdown of entropy', similar in many ways to abstract expressionist paintings (though none of these were shown on the computer slideshow). T opened his eyes and looked up at the computer monitors, the only source of light in the room, but quickly looked away because the screen's light had become too intense. B said the same thing had happened to him, but with an auditory hallucination described as an undulation of the fan noise from the computer. At 1158, B noted a change in how he was perceiving voices. He also noted a change in the perception of time, connected to his body--B said the left side of his body felt as if it was being drawn out, operating more slowly, while the right side of his body felt accelerated. B noted that prominent distortions appeared on edges of things he was looking at. Shortly after this, B noted that he was consumed by thoughts about how others perceive him, especially related to knowledge he has acquired from Wikipedia. B mused on the topic of how psychedelic molecules can intersect with the creation of art and talked earnestly about working on artistic projects in the future. At 1210, B noted further self-reflective thoughts. B noted feeling absolution and resolution of internal conflicts. His vision was filled with soft lines and curls. B said he 'felt like fabric.' At 1215, a monochrome painting appeared on the computer's slideshow. B perception of the painting was not monochrome, but variegated, pulsating colors. At 1220, T and B began vaporizing cannabis. T described the effect as adding an additional, distinct layer to the experience. T did not feel that cannabis had a strong of a synergistic effect that was noted with other tryptamines, for example. At 1225, B launched paint.net on the computer and created an imaged described as interference patterns. B said that he was able to manipulate the image using paint.net to match what he was feeling at the time. At 12:41 B completed the image. At 1353, it was noted that conversation continued in a lucid manner, although T noted difficulty maintaining a linear focus. At 1445, (T+4 hours) T and B repeated the volumetric dosing procedure described above, this time weighing out 14 mg 2C-B and resulting in a supplemental dose of 7 mg. They then each took 100 mg 5-HTP to maintain serotonin production and promote positive sleep and a softer landing coming off the 2C-B. At 1500, T and B continued used of cannabis and a nicotine vaporizer. The effects, according to T, were mildly synergistic. They discontinued use of the vaporizer after a few hits, preferring to not distort the 2C-B effects any further. Shortly after, B said he was able to resolve/reconcile the memory of the impact fracture, which played an important part of the previous 2C-B experience. In his second experience, at a higher dose and with cannabis, the memory of the impact fracture was not present. T's observation was that the 5-HTP resulted in a pleasant sleep, which was effortless at 1800. He woke up renewed and refreshed the following day.","['auditory hallucination', 'breathing', 'catharsis', 'creativity enhancement', 'drifting', 'flowing', 'increased heart rate', 'melting', 'morphing', 'rejuvenation', 'time distortion']",1411
Experience: 15mg 2C-B (oral) - A pleasant low-dose evening with Nexus,"00:00: We both ingested a tiny blue pill advertised as 15mg of 2C-B. 00:40: We started feeling the effects kick in. The come-up reminded me a little bit of MDMA because we felt stimulated, motivated and happy. My girlfriend felt a little bit nauseous (only mildly) but that faded pretty quickly. I had goosebumps, generally felt cold and had tingling sensations all over my body, which weren't comfortable but also not uncomfortable. We enjoyed listening to soft electronic music and felt really connected to it. The music sounded absolutely fantastic and I went into the bathroom to look in the mirror. My pupils were huge and glazed but oddly enough I didn't mind looking at myself on 2C-B, wheras on other psychedelics my face looks strange and unattractive to me. 01:20: My girlfriend and I then took a shower which felt incredible. She described it as feeling like a banana in a chocolate fountain because the water was so warm and felt so heavy on the skin, just like melted chocolate running over something. At that point the open-eye visuals started to get really apparent and symmetric patterns all over the wall emerged. We had two really cool, green pictures in our room which depicted birds sitting on a limb. Somehow we hallucinated a skull, two dogs and a man looking like Albert Einstein in it. These pictures also melted, shifted and moved around when we focused on them and duplicated when we looked away. All the colors were brighter and everything looked liked it was covered in jelly. 02:15: The peak of the experience was approximately at the two hour mark and has been very different from other psychedelics because it felt very wave-like (with a 15mg dosage at least). At one point you could pretty much ignore that you're tripping when you're not focusing on something and then you're fully coalesced with the music and the visuals again. We wrapped ourselves in a blanket, listened to music and closed our eyes which was absolutely beautiful. Depending on the music our closed-eye visuals and our physical senses changed which was pretty interesting. When we listened to Dubstep and Glitch-Hop our bodies felt cold and electric but when we changed the music to something positive we started to get warm rushes through the body and felt very comfortable. 2C-B was extremely clear-headed throughout the experience and there weren't any negative thought loops or confusion (probably due to the low-dose). 03:00: Touching my girlfriends skin felt very different and erotic so we started having sex. Although sometimes briefly losing my erection (because I got distracted so easily) it was VERY enjoyable. I experienced a strong sense of love and connectedness with my partner during intercourse and I had a lot of energy. The orgasm was the most intense and most pleasurable orgasm I've ever had even though it felt shorter than usual. It was so intense that i even broke out into laughter when I ejaculated because I was so overwhelmed by the euphoria. I can whole-heartedly recommend having sex on 2C-B it is truly great. 03:20: We were laying in bed the majority of the time and felt pretty chilled and relaxed but I think if we had decided to stand up and move around I'm sure we would have been energetic and giddy. It's really easy to switch feelings on 2C-B and adjusting yourself to your surroundings (I think going out on 2C-B is possible, if you keep the dosage low and I also would not do it, if you have never tried it before). We were constantly giggling and spent the rest of the time looking at things melt and warp. 04:00: The effects started to slowly diminish at the 4 hour mark and we talked about what we have just experienced. The comedown was very smooth and barely even noticeable. 05:00: Our senses and our sight returned back to normal and we were in a positive mood after the experience. We had no trouble falling asleep about two hours after the effects had worn off. The Day After: There were no signs of a hangover for me (just like with other psychedelics) just a positive little afterglow. My girlfriend felt a little bit exhausted but she had no hangover as well. Conclusion: It was a short & fun trip nothing spiritual & deep like an LSD-trip for example. I think 2C-B is perfectly fine for recreational purposes (especially in low doses) but a good set & setting is still necessary. It was very easy to control the trip and I had a great time with my girlfriend. I absolutely love 2C-B because it provides a lot of unique effects.

Experience:Unknown dosage - Ego death and becoming one with a singular entity,"I had this experience on 3 blotters of what I believe to be 25I-NBOMe due to the taste and numbness in my mouth when I took it although I am not sure of the exact dosage. At what I think was the peak of my trip everything in the room (including me) melted into itself and became one single thing, I experienced ego death and everything collected into to separate spheres of positive and negative which then came together and became neutral or nothing and everything at the same time. I don't have much memory of the trip but I know when I had come partially back to reality I remembered all the people in the room as a part of 1 singular entity that I was also a part of, and I also saw a few people who weren't actually there.

Experience:Becoming a god with my boyfriend,"Hey there! This might be long... Anyways somewhere I at guess 2-4 hours in (I literally couldn't understand the figures on my wrist watch for a long while so i don't know for sure) I had loop in which I persieved my boyfriend and I to be two Indian gods (I am pretty much an atheist by the way.. maybe more agnostic nowadays ) that were creating the known universe over and over again in some kind of mutual joke, and every time we would cast ourselves in it and experience it till it ended and we would end up together on the same plain (that was in fact the bed, heh). And every time it got more and more fucked up (I think this, or the real, universe belonged somewhere in the mid-level of fucked-upness), untill eventually when a universe ended one of us would want it to stop because the joke has gone too far, but the other would just laugh, start a new one and go into it, the other one having to follow (love is a powerful thing you know ). At some point it became like a competition and I realized one of us would have to give up in order for it to stop (things in those universes have apparently gotten pretty bad by that point). I decided it would have to be me and I knew that to do that I would have to die (at this point I was totally disconnected from reality, it was all real in my mind). So I curled up at the edge of the bed and told my boyfriend that I'm tired and I couldn't do it anymore (funny he actually though I meant the trip, he had no idea what I was hallucinating), and I felt myself slowly slipping away while my bf is holding me in his arms, crying (I guess in reality he wasn't crying but he did hold me ). There was a terrible pain in my lower stomach and it got worse and worse till in was all I could presieve. And then it wasnt pain anymore, just... something, that got larger and larger and then I don't really remember what happened, I explained it to myself as just pure experience, from every point of view in the universe... It wasn't good nor bad, it just was.There was some kind of throbbing white thing (I don't want to say light) that was everything, that I later though of as ""singularity"", like before the big bang. After dunno how much time (probably not too long cause my bf would get worried) I just... woke up. I was pretty shaken up, I really didn't expect anything like that and it took me a while to remember what the fuck is going on and that ""I"" was on drugs and back in my own single point of view.. Yeah that shit fucked me up even more for a bit (But a week after that I smoked some changa which really blew my mind and kind of fixed most of the mind fuck, yay drugs!) I hope this was helpful in some way... Keep on the good work!

Experience:Unknown dosage / 3 tabs - Ego death and a total break through in the snow,"Hi there, I saw the post on your blog requesting trip reports and I figured I'd send you a very interesting one I had on a substance I believe to be 25I-NBOMe I'm not going to use real names just because I'm not sure my friends would want me doing that. I was under the impression that it was LSD when I took it, and being a silly kid I took 3 hits without trying a light dose first. I'm not sure the exact dosage but apparently it was really strong my perception of time and the order of events is really off but I would say I started to feel effects in 10-20 minutes after taking it, it numbed my tongue and tasted of harsh chemicals, the first things I noticed were, a bright pink field in the air, almost like crisscrossing pink fibers in the air crossing at a 90 degree angle, they weren't tangible but I could see it, just an illusion, I looked at the wooden floor and saw the wood grain flowing, like goo or a river, and the dust on the floor would move with my foot as if connected by a complex invisible web, we decided to go to my friend G's house, my friends had to help me find my stuff and put my coat on, I couldn't find the arms of my coat to save my life and it seemed like this weird synthetic thing that was limp and damp and I felt disappointed when I put it on, I went into the living room to find my scarf and I was confused when I found it because the pattern that was normally on it wasn't there, it was just blurred into one big read circle on a blue thing. females were creeping me out for some reason, I was with all girls, for some reason I was disturbed by the fact we all had purses, at some points my friends looked like rather disturbing masculine creatures trying to act like females, at this time I wasn't seeing anything too weird. so like 40 min in, I would say, we left for her dads house as we were driving down the street everything looked extremely cartooney like a video game with bad animation, everything looked and felt synthetic, all the houses looked the same and all the streets looked the same and all the trees were perfect patterns, it looked like we kept turning down the same street over and over again, when we finally got out of the car I was overwhelmed with this feeling of excitement, it seemed like everyone was really happy and I started running and jumping around and laughing and yelling, the snow felt like it was kinda deep but apparently it wasn't actually that high, I flopped down in my friends driveway and rolled around in the snow laughing and crying because it was so beautiful, (I included a picture my friend who wasn't tripping took, just because it's kinda funny) my friends were kinda talking to me like I was a small child at this point, so I felt singled out in a strange way, since I was the only one tripping really hard, and I felt like my happiness was making them happy, it was really weird though because I just felt like everything they said they were saying to me or about me (I have this problem any time I trip though) when they were unlocking the door was when I stopped understanding what they were saying for the most part, a lot of words just sounded like gibberish and didn't mean anything to me, I don't remember climbing the stairs, I know when we first got in the kitchen I threw my stuff on the ground and said ""I'm sorry but I just need to lay on the floor,"" and proceeded to lay on the rug in the kitchen, G layed down next to me and I cuddled up to her and proclaimed how much I loved her and after that is when everything is completely out of order and confusing, I'll try my best to give a good explanation. At this point I was seeing level 5 visual geometry, Everything started to look very strange and soft, people eyes got big and shiny, the texture of everything was similar to a pixar cartoon, I can recall hearing my friend say they wanted to take more than one hit of acid, because they had only ever taken one at a time, I could see the emotion for some reason, wanting, I felt like I was experiencing senses that didn't exist, I think I was experiencing concepts, I remember flipping around and everything I knocked into felt really good so I started flipping around the kitchen and knocking into everything that's when stuff started looking really weird, the carpet started to look like cats, like a bunch of cats all sitting on top of each other, I knew it was still the carpet though, I looked out the door over the balcony and all the trees started to look like 2 dimensional cartoon arms, that's when I started to have level 6 geometry, the arms branched out and covered my whole vision, everything was made of arms, I can't remember what happened after this. I remember being in this strange world, (I was still partially aware that I was on a drug and with my friends, I don't think I was aware of who's house I was at and why we were all there or anything.) it was like I could let people into this world and once they were there they would understand everything, and I thought people would be angry that I was there but once I let them in they would understand, and I felt completely free from everything, I was overwhelmed with joy, everything in this world was very colorful there was a lot of blue pink and yellow, also mint green, purple, and gold. I could see my friends still, it was like I was in a strange tunnel though, I kept talking about how we should be using the acid we took for science, as in scientific research, to study consciousness and how the brain works and philosophy, my friend A asked me (or maybe someone else) how the stuff we took compared to my friend P's acid. A looked like a yellow cartoon cat with blue eyes, 2D, not detailed at all that I can remember. After she said that everyone and everything including me turned into this swirling color pattern of mostly blue pink and yellow and it was the emotion happiness, it was like a wave, it was 2 dimensional I think I may have blacked out during this time because I don't have any memory of what happened afterwards. The next thing I remember was looking at my friend G, she said something to me but it didn't make any sense and it was like a computer glitching, my brain felt like a computer glitching, and I just remember her going ah? ah? In an inquisitive tone and then ahhh in a disappointed one like she was going do you understand? do you understand? then nah you don't, I could make out words, I'm not sure who was saying them her or me, but it was like a glitch feeling, it was ""nothing #glitch makes #glitch shmense"" (sense but it sounded like smense haha) then everything started separating from itself as in senses, the color of a table would separate from the texture and the idea of a table and then it connected in different ways, Started with the blending of my vision, I was looking at a friends face then gazed past and looked at the wall, first I became confused and couldn't distinguish what was the wall and what was the table and what was my friend, it was all just a part of my vision (also I was unable to understand words and had no idea where I was, who my friend was or WHAT she was, I didn't know what a human was, so I looked over her shoulder, couldn't separate objects from each other, then I couldn't separate colors, then smells tastes physical sensations emotions or anything including myself from all of this, ""I"" disappeared as is me my name my body my personality, they all blended together and went upward, it was like the room was sucked up and there was nothing left but black nothingness behind 2 energy balls made of everything that could ever be perceived, and a consciousness observing it, it wasn't really black but there was nothing there, hard to imagine nothing. Every sense and emotion and color and everything separated into 2 balls that looked white, one made of one thing and the other made of everything that contrasted what the other was made of, ""positive and negative"" consciousness observed streams come from the orbs and flow together in the middle, spreading out and back in in the center of the 2 orbs, in the center the streams the ""energies"" collided and because they were exact opposites they canceled each other out, and when the 2 separate orbs had completely merged there was nothing, no consciousness, no black or white no me or anything, it was nirvana and there was no time, no temperature, nothing that could ever be perceived and no one to not perceive anything. It is hard not to talk about it with a certain amount of mysticism, because a lot of people don't know how to describe things like this without using metaphors, because there are no words that have been invented to describe it! Streams looked more like webs, almost like smoke or a thin layer of white everything over black nothing in circles going from a small point of half of everything -> spreads out in every direction and loops into a specific point -> meets other energy at specific point and match each other to become neutral <- spreads out in every direction and loops into a specific point <- a small point of half of everything The next thing I remember was a few eyeballs swirling very calmly in a circle in front my vision, with nothing but black in the background, they were blue, rather realistic, then yellow cats, 3D they would stick out their tongues and open their eyes wide and spin in the circle faster when I would move around, the eyeballs would open wider and spin faster and they would leave tails of colors behind them blues pinks yellows greens reds purples, so I starting moving and kicking and throwing myself in different directions really hard and fast. I saw my friend G and she suggested something to me I don't know what it was but it had something to do with hippies or something, once again I was experiencing concepts, it was like we were making a pact, and it had happened before, it was like a spiritual pact, I don't really know, but I started kicking and moving my arms and body as fast and hard as I could, as if my life depended on it, and when I did that the cats and eyeballs would spin faster and open up and more colors would come off of them and the eyes would open super wide and something would come out of the center of them, they were completely realistic 3 dimensional and they just floated above my normal vision, the more I would kick and punch the faster and more intricate and intense they would get, I saw eyeballs and psychedelic patterns on everything, the bed the couch the floor my fingers my friends, I was under the impression I was working towards some goal, I hallucinated my friend P, who wasn't actually there, came into the room and I kept yelling his name as well as G's and 2 of my other friends, they were all a part of this thing I was doing, the air kept swirling like over a grill, and I could see these crazy green dragon type things and P would say something like ""niiiccee"" telling me to calm down and the patterns would get more intense and beautiful all the people there felt like my family and everything in the room held sentimental value, it was like everything was a distant memory that i was coming back to, my friends were pouring water on me, which I was unaware of for the most part, but I kept feeling something really strange it was like my hallucinations were licking my body and they would get more intense when they would pour water on me, I saw my parents and they kept trying to help me with this thing, I felt like everyone was trying to help me, and contributing as well, we kept reaching new levels of whatever it was, things kept folding out, hallucinations, feelings, people, they would get more and more intricate, I was starting to get tired from punching and kicking I had to keep going in different directions because the force pushing against me was too strong when I kept going in one direction, I felt like once I reached one thing I could never stop moving on and up, there wasn't a goal to stop at, the goal was never ending and I could never stop moving up and going further, my parents kept telling me that I had to stop and I was going to die and that there were medics that were going to come and I kept saying that I knew I could do it and that we couldn't stop, and apparently we weren't the only group of people that had done this and there were these groups that had done this, and we were one of the groups that got the farthest, it was like time didn't matter, the people that I had heard had done this before and gotten the furthest was us, and I couldn't stop because I would lose all the people and they were so important to me and every person with me had this insane special meaning to everyone with us, we were combining or something, someone called the police (not in real life)((I think?)) I could see the red and blue lights flashing and hear the sirens but I couldn't leave because I couldn't stop, my body was cut in half (because in reality I had cut my left foot really badly on a nail sticking out of a chair) and there was dark blue liquid coming up out of the floor and ceiling, there would be a flash and bruises and cuts would well up all over my body and blood would come out there was water and cat food floating in the air and I kept saying no no no I can't let you go no no no I can't let you go I remember flashes of friends handing me clothes, A asked me if I was cold and tried to put a blanket on my which I immediately threw off of me as well as the bra she tried to hand me, and my friend p's mala, I threw it because it was doing something to the energy fields in the room when I threw things. eventually my friends got me to put my clothes and coat on, I was still hallucinating p and another friend with us and they were getting their winter stuff on too, and we all left together, which looking back on it must have messed up what I was thinking because when we got in the car everything was horrible, I was hallucinating the sounds of burps and farts, G turned into another friend who has been accused of being a rapist, and he slid over next to me put his hand on my leg and said ""how ya doin?"" in a really sleazy way, at this point I wasn't having any whimsical hallucinations or really any visual ones other than my friends turning into other people, there was no geometry or anything, I was having auditory hallucinations. Everything was negative and everything that happened seemed to be a paradox, my whole life was a paradox, we got back to G's moms house and I layed down on the couch and didn't talk to anyone I don't know what people were actually saying to me but it appeared to me that they were talking to me from a script and I had to say what I was supposed to or something bad would happen to me, and I was certain that I was going to be alone forever Submitted by - H0bcnd2","['abnormal heartbeat', 'and sociability enhancement', 'changes in gravity', 'drifting', 'ego death', 'empathy', 'external hallucination', 'geometry', 'love', 'mouth numbing', 'outrospection', 'pattern recognition enhancement', 'perception of decreased weight', 'perception of interdependent opposites', 'personal bias suppression', 'perspective distortions', 'spontaneous tactile sensations', 'stimulation', 'symmetrical texture repetition', 'synaesthesia', 'temperature regulation suppression']",3246
Experience:Unknown dosage / 1 tabs - Prolonged unity and messiah syndrome at school,"Prolonged unity + messiah syndrome I took one tab of Nbome at school. First of all I went to gym class - it was swimming, which was pretty fun, but the substance itself didn't really hit me until I was naked in the changing room shower with all these girls who were freshman. I was a junior, so this created a weird feeling for some reason. On top of this it was winter, I had forgotten my towel, I had just shaved my head, I had yellow paint on my face, I was the only person in the room who doesn't shave her legs or armpits, and because of this it was just weird vibes all around. Despite all of this, however, I still felt a strange sense of family with these kids. A common feeling that often happens while I am tripping. I was staring in the mirror and suddenly became really confused. I almost went into a panic because I couldn't remember what was going on, so I calmed down by simply telling myself ""it's OK, you're going to English class now, everything is OK and you are just at school"". I succeeded in calming myself down and went to English class, which is across the street as our school is on two different sides of the road. It was in English class that it really hit me; we were reading a poem about how man is disconnected from nature and I couldn't separate colors as separate objects. I would look down at my paper and everything around me would blend into this colored pattern. I looked around me and noticed that everybody looked like these really weird animals, and I mean humans really are just animals anyway. It also seemed that everybody was acting so much colder, harder and less affectionate than they really felt. After this I had art class, I was trying to draw this picture of trees but the trees kept just transforming into a kaleidoscopic eyeball pattern thing and which made it very hard. I was talking to this girl who I don't really like because she talks so much and always interrupts me, but we had a good conversation and I was feeling a lot of love for people. She seemed like a wounded animal to me, afraid to open up for fear of being injured and I was trying to get her to feel comfortable and secure. We had a good conversation about the Beatles. That was my last class of the day and once school had finished a good friend suggested that we go to the race and diversity club. I agreed so we walked across the street towards the club, but as I was crossing I saw a former teacher of mine and for some reason this triggered a vision - despite the fact that up until this point I had been coming down. As soon as it hit me, it was as if time had stopped; I saw a street sign, then the city I live in (Lakewood), the state of Ohio, then America, the world, the solar system, the universe, and finally I saw something which I had previously seen in another trip but since forgotten about. This was a vision of positive and negative energy expanding outwards and into each other to form neutral-nothing-nirvana. The only way I could describe it would be: imagine a black backdrop, the black backdrop is nothing, nothing exists there, then there are 2 white spheres; one is the opposite of the other, not really sure how you could tell, but I just knew they were opposites. A fountain-shaped, wispy web-like structure emerges from the white spheres, like they are drops of food coloring in water, going in opposite directions. They expand infinitely, in very complex directions, then once they have gone as far out as they will go (which is forever, ironically), they loop around and head back to the center, where the opposite energies neutralize each other, and everything goes back to black. I came back into reality and though ""HOLY SHIT"" to myself. I hadn't remembered this vision until then but it seemed that tripping had brought back memories of really intense experiences that I had previously forgotten, due to drug-induced amnesia. As well as my brain blocking out traumatic experiences from it. We eventually made it to the room where race and diversity club is held, and all I could think of is how we are all the same person. I didn't hallucinate that we were all connected visually or anything, but I was living with the complete reality that everyone around me was a part of a giant, fractured psyche. It was almost like I was a person with multiple personality disorder realizing that all these people that exist are also ME and it was my job, with this knowledge, to put us all back together. I realized that I was supposed to do this by loving and accepting everyone with a strong sense of urgency. If you were to imagine going up to a person you really love and saying ""I love you"", and when they say it back nonchalantly, say it really seriously, like ""no I LOVE"" you, and just keep saying it and meaning it over and over until something kinda clicks inside of you and you both would most likely begin begin to cry or writhe in ecstasy, or your souls fall out your asses and join in the cosmos. This is essentially what I felt that I had to do with everyone and what I had to get them to do with everyone else. It felt as if doing this would result in us all becoming progressively more abstract until we all reached a single unified point. Throughout all of this I had to acknowledge, think about, accept, and love all bad things about people. I understood that I would have to imagine the person nude, think about all their sexual organs, think about them pooping, peeing, screaming, all the ways they are greedy, all their imperfections including ones they might not even be able to help, brain damage, all social awkwardness, the ways they have been stunted, the plaque on their teeth, their bodily scars, and the event that caused those scars, their misconceptions and delusions, and all the ways they hurt others. I would have to LOVE the fuck all of those things about them, as well as all good things. Everybody around me began to take the form of fucked up cartoons. I knew that had to love them all, I wanted to and I did but it was scary and wonderful. I didn't speak a word the whole meeting, except when someone asked me why I wasn't talking. I don't remember what I said. After this I went to Subway with my two best friends, one with whom I can be silly, and one with whom I can be serious, which was a very good combination of 2 people. Once we were there the silly friend got up to get a drink I whispered to the serious one, ""I have something really important I need to tell you"". I proceeded to tell her about my experience and that we were all the same person, but she simply told me she was glad that I had a religious experience. This immediately killed my thoughts on telling her what I was feeling because I realized she didn't really understand what I was trying to tell her, which was that it's my job to put the universe back together because I know that it needs to be put back together. It was the knowledge that made it my job, as in the fact that I had that knowledge made it my responsibility. I just thought for some reason she would understand what I was saying or want to understand and want to help, but she didn't. This led onto feelings of alienation because I felt that I was the only person who really understood what I was trying to say and do, which gave me a feeling of responsibility and importance. It was after this that I started to become extremely religious on a delusional level, and not necessarily in a traditional sense. I developed my own religion, my gods being people who I had visions about during another trip; four friends, my mother, father, and myself. I started wearing a mala one of those friends had given me and created a symbol that I tattooed onto my hand. Its a circle surrounded by 8 dots; the circle being a circle around nothing, making nothing something, the dots being the something separated into separate things, concepts etc. I vowed to love everyone with nothing in return, be nice to everyone, and got rid of so many of my material possessions (which I still don't regret). I decorated myself every day in the way that was exactly as I wanted to present myself, or as close as I could come to it. I barely ever spoke and when I did it was mostly to ask questions. I never turned down a request for a favour, I started volunteering on weekends, I was never at my house, I always seemed to be dirty, cold and hungry as I never took time to rest. I got sick a lot, I ended up sleeping outside a lot for various reasons, and I can't even remember parts of my winter. The unity lasted for about a month or two, but step by step it slowly faded with each new concept and realization that I experienced. It wasn't a fast come down, it lasted a few months. The first month was solid unity. After two months I was still pretty up there, I was completely psychotic and convinced that I was a religious martyr but could not really place why. After three months I progressed a few more steps, I realized that I wasn't a modern day Jesus but I was still up on a moral pedestal. After the next couple months I started getting into a serious state of anger because I feel like I have been doing everything I could but no one knew or appreciated it, and started feeling very depressed and alone. By the end of the spring to fall I had slipped into a deep depression. I lost connections to people who are very important to me, gave up helping people, start taking stolen Xanex and drinking alcohol, which finally knocked me off my moral pedestal. At this point I now place myself on the same moral level as those around me (thank god for that), and started getting back into reality more and more. I am still not back into the same reality as everyone else I feel but I feel as though I am getting there. Feel free to ask as many questions as you need. Were you one with god or just the universe? Did you feel one with the creation of the universe or just as it is in its present form? I hope that makes sense. I felt one with the creation of the universe, but not in that moment. In that moment I had a flashback of the time that I was one with the creation of the universe, which was the first trip report. In that moment I felt one with the universe, as it's in its present form, which is why the unity lasted so long, probably because I didn't have to be hallucinating to know it, or feel it, see it, etc. It was right there in front of me all the time - still is - I still know and can sometime still get close to that state of mind, which can be useful but also scary and sad, depending on what I am observing. Like I know the whole universe is connected to me but consciousness is experiencing the universe through Rebecca's eyes during this unity, so it sees the examples of how everything is playing out through her eyes, like how bad things that have happened negatively effect people I am close to, how they are all related, what caused them, what cause those things, how it can be fixed, and feeling the emotional pain that those around me are feeling because of whatever the matter at hand is. And just loving that person and feeling their pain because they are me, consciousness feels that pain because it's in all of us, therefore Rebecca feels that pain because consciousness is in her, that's how we are all connected, all you have to do is turn it on. I had to figure out how to turn it off for a minute to gather my thoughts and get my life straight.

Experience:1000ug / 1 tab - No sense of enlightenment but absolutely breath taking visuals,"Spontaneously decided to dose with my best friend on a drunken night in college. Come up was much like that of 25C-NBOMe, rapid, numbing of the mouth, bitter, etc. Had the constant feeling as though I were about to yawn but did not and paced quite frequently. Went upstairs feeling that I had to be alone, and lay down on my friend's bed. The drug had a pleasant body sensation but I soon began to move uncontrollably, I think almost slowly but in a way that I couldn't really stop. I saw my arms and legs moving in the air without being able to stop it, and I began to salivate profusely and drooled off the side of my friend's bed. I felt hot and my heart may or may not have been racing (again, long time ago). I remember feeling that I must be dying but was actually okay with it and accepted it and stared into my friend’s hallway light. Some time passed and my seizure eventually subsided. I think my friend (on 25I) came in and I told him and he said I should have got someone. And I think I mentioned it around the group tripping down stairs (2 on LSD, myself and 2 others on 25I, one on 25C), but some people did not really notice except my one friend (on LSD). We went onto my friend's balcony and I remember having very vivid visuals of the shadow of a lamp-post branching out into very spindly, geometric fractals. I said ""Who needs DMT if you have this?"" (prior to trying it later on!), in reference to the intensity of the visuals (on 25C I stared at the ceiling which began with a fractal pattern and then the whole ceiling opened up at the bricks into blackness, feeling similarly). - not really relevant We went back inside and the other person who I had not met before and had no prior experience with NBOMes (although mine is not super vast either) seemed to be weirdly psychologically affected by the drug to the point of making me extremely uncomfortable. He was psycho-analyzing my other friend on 25I, asking repeatedly asking him the same pseudo-philosophical questions that actually made no sense. My friend seemed exhausted but dutifully answered all of his questions and I was freaked out, imagining all of these paranoid scenarios in which this guy had stalked us and was following us, entertaining that he was some inside-guy of some sort. He continued to blab loops of questions and sounded extremely condescending while blabbing nonsense. I just sat on the arm of my friend’s chair feeling extremely awkward and drained from the seizure- no more euphoric pleasant feelings, more just paranoia. Later most people filtered out, and the annoying blabbing guy took the most to leave. At this point I was heavily believing the delusions and remained where I sat, convinced that if I moved he would try something against my friend. Eventually my friend (whose house it was) and I went upstairs, him trying to sleep, and me because I was too afraid to leave his house. I kept thinking paranoid thoughts until the guy had left. Morning had come. I then cried a great deal about everything, and fretted about other emotional conflicts (my boyfriend, etc.) and could not sleep and felt super on edge. Then I eventually left my friend to go back to my dorm feeling paranoid and looking over my shoulder the whole way. With the NBOMes (I’ve done 25I once, 25C probably 3 times) I never really feel any sense of enlightenment, more just feeling confused and jumping around from thought to thought (my best friend and I would often joke that 25C was “woop!”, the sound of an extremely thought welling up inside but then leaving before we could articulate it or remember). The visuals are absolutely breath taking and are truly astonishing/immersive (more so than traditional LSD/psilocybin). My thoughts never seem intelligent to me, just “fucked up”. I’ve also done some drawings on 25C, trying to draw the pattern that seems directly in front of my vision (rather than ebbing and flowing as the do with traditionals) and they’ve turned out very creepy and have disturbed me while sober. Overall, other than the visuals I’ve had fairly negative experiences with them, but this was the most uncomfortable. On 25C I’ve gotten some disturbing feelings as well, such as being extremely disgusted by my own body and the feeling of hair coming out of my mouth and a strange split before my teeth that I can feel with my tongue (very gross). One time the next day I felt almost high the entire day, not on NBOMe, but a euphoria that I was happy to be alive and no longer feeling so horrible. I went on an eighth mushroom trip the next day (25C), feeling super elated and happy. Throughout the entire mushroom trip (in the freezing snow for six hours, getting numb and struggling to walk at points) with my two other friends I was extremely elated the entire time and it was a great trip, though I never felt out of control or anything (but I tend not to on psychedelics). I think it may have seemed that I was tripping less (due to a 25C-NBOMe/psilocybin cross tolerance), but I am not entirely sure as one of my friends said it seemed as though I was. It was also a shroom tea, so I am not entirely sure if that would have diluted it either! Super long, apologies, but a lot came back as I was writing! Hope this is interesting/fun to read!

Experience:2mg 25C-NBOMe - Experimental trip to test personal limits of NBOMes,"Post-processed storyline I figure I should have some real writeup, some real explanation of the things that I saw preceding the ingestion, since I never really wrote anything, only scrambled confusion of a person who didn’t even know their own name. At the time of the report my mind was accelerated and heightened, my world was crumbling and shifting and swirling around me, everything was swaying and convulsing in the most gorgeous way I could ever imagine, but I know there is still more to be found. When I put the two tabs into my mouth I was ready for something unknown, something scary, something different, I was ready to be sucked into a portal of confusion and doubt, of fear and ecstasy, I was ready to face the monsters and demons locked away deep in the far recesses of my brain, but this was not what I received. What I received was majestic, was soft but fierce, was riveting. I didn’t dab until the nausea was gone, the visuals started later this time, but the physical effects began looming over me after nine or so minutes. The numbing came before the visuals, which started probably 18 minutes after ingestion, and right before the nausea got too bad for me to sit upright. I fled to my room, to the safety and the quiet of my little enclosed place, remembering the afternoon I spent reeling and shaking from the melting surfaces and dark nosed men and women who sifted through my terrors when I consumed 6g of cubensis caps. This was different, the physical effects left me uncomfortable, but not as bad as last time, I didn’t puke. I rolled about in my bed for a good twenty minutes, waiting for it to pass, my mind still clear, still logical, still coherent. I was messaging friends, the screen on my phone was like water, with the text painfully engraved in the LED strips bulging and drifting from their rightful places. It looked like the surface of alphabet soup, letters started drifting out of line, into the upper reaches of the searing whiteness, which permeated with rainbow waves that surged up the surface. When I stood up the nausea had not quite yet passed, I was not as limber as I am usually, the body high felt too light and not all-encompassing, not yet. It had spread to my legs and my arms, but not to my chest, which still stood heavy above my quaking limbs. I sat at my desk, my monitor bending and my shades flashing and flowing with bright colors, the light shown through the cracks illuminating my apartment with such golden beauty that I almost started crying. I dabbed, waited for about ten minutes, collected my things, and set out to explore the home that had once stood stationary and indifferent to my existence. This is what I love about psychedelics, this moment, when I open the door and the light floods my pupils and suddenly the world is changed, vivaciously altered, teeming with blinking lights and swinging creatures. At first things didn’t look different, I was disappointed, everything was still the same color, but then I noticed it, in the distance, the world was upside down. Like a spiral the sidewalk and street shifted up and over my head, looming in the distance, rocking back and forth, turned to squiggled blacks and shifting patterns. The sky, blue and empty, breathed and moaned under the heat of the sun, which emanated a spiral of blues and oranges and yellows, meshing and mingling into mesmerising spindled patterns. Beaming and leading me on, the sun was stationary somehow, stuck smack dab in the middle of this wormhole I found myself stepping down. As if the landscape was a sheet of paper and someone had picked it up and twisted it into a tube, the other side of the sidewalk leaped above me, unwelcoming and cutting me off. A woman was walking towards me, I couldn’t tell what she looked like, draped in this bulging purple dress (shirt? hoodie? cape? skin?) she waddled towards me, her face bending and bulging, eyes turning to diamond encrusted spirals, turning and blinking in the looming brightness. When she passed, her side bulged out into my space, and I had to step away to avoid her running into me, she even gave me a crooked, toothy smile, which ran from ear to ear, splitting her sweaty face in two. I grimaced, tried to ignore it, focused on the road in front of me. I passed a man who seemed statuesque, anchored there to the ground, waiting for a bus, a book in one hand, which I assumed to contain the entirety of this traveler’s life, his beard morphing and shifting into different colors and shapes, curling around his eyes and ears, protruding in an abnormal fashion outward, it reached for me, I could see every individual hair, every individual speck of skin on his youthful face. His eyes, they were pits, guarded by gleaming sunglasses, which were wavy on his face. I passed him in seconds, he looked at me, but I not at him. It was time to cross the street into the curling sidewalk, to turn entirely upside down. The, now rising and falling, sea of concrete and greenery before me, folding infinitely inwardly into the distance, I now knew that I controlled the wormhole, that I WAS the wormhole. A car passed, I jumped, it was terrifying, screaming passed me with malicious eyes, two faces adorned the front and the back. The front, a look of abashed confusion, the back, a look of rage and disgust, with cross eyebrows and furrowed brow, it mouthed words of hate and wishes of death to me as it soared along the bubbling and churning asphalt. I passed over the white lines, careful to step on each individually, my music pumping through my body, keeping my feet planted firmly on the ground, guiding my heart’s rhythm. I could feel it coursing through my veins, leading me towards the all but unknown. The park was mesmerising, it teemed with life, I kept thinking everything was normal, that these people I was seeing, they were normal, but when I looked at them I saw placid expressions, glazed eyes, alien faces. Haughty and high browed, ears pointing out, facial hair morphing and undulating upon their gargoyle countenances. The trees shuffled above me, shielded my brow from the heat beating down on me, I was now not sure where my body began and ended with the Earth, it was as if my feet had merged with the concrete. I could not gauge my speed, I tried walking faster, but I couldn’t tell if it was working, so I just slowed down and kept looking around me. In slow motion everyone moved about, mouthing with gaping jaws words that I could not even hope to decipher. I found gravel, my feet unstable, but I kept going. The tracers were just ridiculous, every miniscule movement, every big movement was followed by several re-iterations of the previous matter’s course. I experienced mild disassociation, the environment seemed very far away from me, as if I was in a different dimension but able to see into my normal dimension. I felt as though there was a bubble around me, keeping me far from the jittering, spiraling, screaming plantlife. Trees were without eyes, but made faces at me, some smiled, some screaming, some filled with darkness and voids that would certainly lead to hell. I felt cold air sucking in through the ones with holes, the blackness calling to me, so I stayed far way from them. I sat down on a bench and looked at my phone, someone was Skyping me, so I decided to try and answer, I even joined their call when they called me, but couldn’t work up the courage or focus to get anything coherent out of my mouth, I just sort of giggled and the insanity of it all and hung up. As I stared into the blinding whiteness of Skype and the world around me fractalled like you wouldn’t believe, everything was turning and going outwards in odd directions infinitely, I couldn’t even handle looking at my phone for too long because the world started rocking back and forth in my peripheral vision. When I lifted my head the fractals slowly dissipated but the world remained highly detailed and swimming, the sun and buildings in the distance seemed to be at a tilt, they rocked back and forth as if I were on a boat, music pumped through my ears, it had such unfathomable energy that I started crying because it was just so intense. I fucking loved it. I wandered down into the rose garden area, where the flowers were and people were slowly strolling along. It was pretty early still, probably around 10:00, so not many people were out, especially on a hot Saturday in August. It was mostly older couples, they were really cute. I changed the music to The Last Song by Tom Misch, and suddenly the world got highly saturated and the sun’s beating heat became much more bearable. I felt my body go at ease, my breathing became steady, I walked around slowly and gazed at the turning flowers, which were bright and speckled with extreme acuity, geometric patterns would move up and down their surfaces if I focused hard enough, and whenever I would focus on anything the world around it would melt away into a kaleidoscope texture. I felt very much at peace, I was very happy, the world was kind and beautiful and the sun hugged me warmly, but I wasn’t uncomfortable. I went and laid down next to the fountain, water flecking my face, I dropped my hand into the pool and let it sink down into the cool water. An immense sense of peace consumed me, and would set the tone for the rest of the trip. I felt incredibly attractive, happy, at ease, my body was light and pure, the world was bright and shining in the summer sun, clouds changed shape and color and looked almost cartoonish, everything was moving and steadily bouncing in the wind, like little cartoon people. I sat at the fountain for about an hour, felt a sense of quiet that I had needed so badly. I got up after a while, changed the music to some Chainsmokers remixes, and walked over to the cafe, I felt like I needed to get something practical done for some reason. By this point my concept of time was completely shattered, I couldn’t distinguish one minute from the next, everything just kind of meshed, and my thoughts were travelling in parallel instead of serial, I would come up with thoughts and analyse them immediately and expand them infinitely as they happened, sometimes with more concepts than one. I decided that I definitely need to go into science, that my life is on a rocket upward, all of my friends are becoming more and more involved in my life, people like me more than they ever have before, I finally am accepting how fucking neat I am and it’s amazing to have a bit of confidence after years and years of sulking in the background. The walk to the cafe was longer than I remembered, the sun hadn’t fully risen yet, it was still crispy outside, the cars that went by were blurs of white and silver and blue and gold, the houses bulged and shrunk and changed shapes, doors looked like mouths, and suddenly I realised that all the houses were full of lives and people and entire worlds of drama and emotions that I had no part of. That was an amazing discovery, they contained such mystery, so much energy, I had a brand new appreciation for houses and closed doors in general. They made faces at me, most of them smiling or positive. I made it to the cafe and by this time the ground would bend and sink beneath my feet when I walked on it, like I was walking on a giant trampoline. Again, pretty intense fish eye effect on the concrete, when I looked down the lines would swirl and bend into squiggly lines instead of straight ones. I got into the cafe, instant stress, there was no one in there except for the usuals (I’m one of them) that are always there in the mornings. I waited, trembling, for the girl at the counter to finish making a drink so that I could order, I had no idea what I wanted, the entire room was a deep brown and red and was melting all around me. The chalkboard turned on its side and changed shapes fluidly, the people, again, looked stationary, different, I was in a different dimension, they felt so fucking far away from me. I managed to squeak out an order, gave her my money, and waited, more stressed than before. However stressed I was, though, I didn’t feel like I was going to lose it, I was pretty calm and collected outwardly (I think), but inwardly I just wanted to get the fuck out of there. I got my coffee, sat outside, there was a homeless dude on the other side of the row of chairs I sat down in, I ignored him. I stared at the rising sun and the saturation returned to the world, the sidewalk seething like an ocean, words jumbling up, I experienced a bit of scenery splicing when the world kind of cut apart as I drank my coffee. It felt weird, I couldn’t really taste it, it just was hot and viscous. I didn’t really ENJOY drinking it, but I had committed so I finished the damned thing and set it back inside before walking onto the empty Portland Community College campus, I walked around there dancing my heart out to the music I was listening to, oogling at the flowers, but when I saw there were bugs I had to get away because bugs really freak me out. I sat down on a bench under a tree and it started looking like organs and writhing bugs so I was like “nope” and got out of there as soon as possible. This was when I started experiencing autonomous entities speaking to me. I was sitting down listening to Tycho and from the corner of my eye I saw something gold materialise slowly, I turned to look at it and it disappeared, so I just forgot about it. The next time I saw it out of the corner of my eye it hung there, gold ribbons turning and floating, forming the shape of some very tall and thin figure. I took out my headphones and watched it from the corner of my eye, as it slowly took shape, its face nearly indistinguishable, there were too many things happening on its body, the gold turned to shapes and lines and formations that I couldn’t even follow, it seemed to have a universe in its body. It hummed and cooed at me, I got startled and looked over at it and it disappeared. I realised then how bad it would be to be tripping too hard would be like, I thought that if I kept hearing them and seeing them out of the corner of my eye I would lose my mind. Luckily they stopped appearing after that, but that one had hung around for a while, I felt like it followed me around, I only saw it one more time, near the end of my peak. From here I went inside one of the buildings and sat down watching shapes spiral out of the sun and the windows splitting the great green and blue outside into squares. It wasn’t cubism, but I did experience that after I went home and dabbed. Before I did this I had a short argument with a cardboard black man wearing a college graduation gown and hat, it was really odd. I don’t really know where that came from, but it ended with me flipping him off and calling him a “bitch ass scholar n’ shit.” I walked home from here, I wanted to write more stuff down into my computer and record what was happening. I got home, dabbed, visuals intensified immediately. The melting visuals returned, everything was alive again, my blood boiled and I get suddenly energised. I went back outside, of course, after trying to talk to people online became too difficult because my computer kept melting and shapeshifting in front of me. The world was different, again, more colorful, more stable, but I experienced the most epic environmental cubism I ever have. Everything was split into a million different little views, like I was looking at the world through a jumbled mess of windows, all showing me something slightly different. It was so awesome. I had really high visual pattern recognition, I saw lions in the tree leaves, the giant trees that hung in the park became watchers and defenders of the great rose garden, and there was a wedding going on in the park. I sat and watched the ceremony at the gazebo, I was upset because I wasn’t well dressed enough for the occasion, I had only a polo and khakis, and boat shoes were most definitely not wedding attire. Oh well, it was funny, I laughed about it for a while. Still had intense tracers, movements were in slow motion, I watched two trees have what looked like an argument in the wind. I couldn’t make out what they were saying, but their faces looked almost insect like, and they moved with the wind. It wasn’t scary at all, just intense. I sat around the park for another while, watched everything move and breathe in the sun, it was so beautiful. I got into really intense thought, realised my strengths and weaknesses, finally In understood what I needed to do with my life. I decided that I must go into science, that my greatest skill is the translation of ideas, which I believe is true, and that, with this skill, I can do good for the world, maybe help it improve. Many people simply don’t understand things because they aren’t worded in a way that they are able to comprehend. If I can bridge this small gap, the whole world can be a much better place. As I started to come down I felt elated and happy, this new experience proving to be very intense and quite lovely. I was satisfied, and the world started slowly turning back into normal life, I slowly drifted back into the dimension I had come from, I was able to formulate words again, I went home and decided I would talk to friends and dab again. It helped the the sudden drop in stimulation, and maintained slight visuals until about 5:00pm that night. All in all pretty good day.","['amnesia', 'anxiety suppression', 'autonomus entities', 'cognitive euphoria', 'diffraction', 'double vision', 'emotion enhancement', 'environmental cubism', 'language suppression', 'mouth numbing', 'muscle cramps', 'nausea', 'pattern recognition enhancement', 'perception of decreased weight', 'pupil dilation', 'restless leg syndrome', 'simultaneous emotions', 'temperature regulation suppression', 'thought connectivity', 'time distortion', 'tracers', 'visual acuity enhancement', 'visual drifting (breathing)', 'visual drifting (melting)', 'visual drifting (morphing)']",3836
Experience:1mg 25c-NBOMe - Experiment in my room,"T0:00-Tab is extremely bitter and tastes like gross chemicals. Extremely unpleasant. Makes my tongue very numb. T0:30-Starting to feel ""high"", feeling lightheaded and dazed. Slight visuals in the form of a barely noticeable colorful pattern overlayed on everything. T0:40-Feeling very ""high"". Visuals are still the same level, feel like I've just smoked a ton. Feeling lightheaded, elated, happy, dazed, and having the same strange thought processes that weed gives me. T0:45-Visuals starting to kick in harder. Things starting to breathe and vibrate. I feel like I'm vibrating and resonating with my surroundings. Even though I am in the dark, everything is very colorful. Any source of light has a rainbow halo around it. Everything light colored has a rainbow sheen. Dark objects begin to have blurry outlines and become very ambiguous in shape. Teeth grinding starts to kick in so I chew some gum. T0:50-Visuals reaching full force. Fractals begin to fill my vision and overlay everything. Every dark or uniform area of my room becomes filled with swirling fractals and mirrored repeating shapes. Tracers are very evident with every movement. Objects begin to change proportions, breathing, stretching, vibrating, warping, and swirling. My body feels like its being rocked back and forth like its on a boat. There is an owl made of fractals on my ceiling, staring down at me. THe rest of my ceiling has taken a grid shape that extends into infinity, each square of the grid filled with flashing spiraling shapes. Beams of light crisscross my ceiling, and random flashes of light are in the corners of my vision. These fractals don't feel ""organic"" but rather much mroe synthetic, with sharper angles and edges. My computer screen has fucked up proportions, with text warping and swirling, and all white space being filled with pulsating rings of rainbow colors. T0:55-Huge flashing ghost images begin appearing all over my field of view. They look like rainbow colored holograms. Most notably are giant flying insects-hornets and wasps and beetles. They make me feel really happy and are flying in circles all around my room. These soon get replaced by huge armored figures standing in my room. THey are wearing impractically huge fantasy armor with lots of spikes and bells and whistles, stoically standing there and watching me. They aren't vivid or realistically colored, but rather are translucent and rainbow colored. Ghost images follow everything I look it, blurring my vision, but they eventually dissolve into spiraling swirling fractals and flashing colors. Very interesting effect. The breathing of everything gets more intense. I can literally feel my room breathing, I can feel hot moist breath on me. I feel very sweaty. The walls are breathing in and out. My room is a living thing and I am inside of it. T1:00-My bedsheets have circles on them (not in this state, I mean that's the design on them). Looking at them, there are detailed human faces in each circle, each one looks hostile and is staring at me in some sort of unhappy manner. I don't really mind though, and I glare back at them. My computer keys are all changing in size and shape. The keyboard is lit up and rainbows are spiraling out of the light of each key, making typing hard but fascinating. Very little body load, extremely visual. Still feel like I'm on a boat/in a breathing entity. I try to stand up and realize I can't feel my legs. They feel cold and numb, but not like frozen numb, just numb like I've been sitting on them for a while. Walking is hard and I am having a hard time balancing. I sit back down, and feel immensely heavy. I feel like my insides are sloshing around like I am a water balloon. This wears off rather quickly though. T1:10-I start to look at my mineral collection. They are all beautiful and emitting rainbows. The crystals are all mirrored and breathing and pulsating rainbows and fractals. I decide to get off my computer for about 15 minutes to really sink into the trip. I stand up and lie on my bed and stare at my ceiling and blast some music. Lights that look like comets and amorphous blobs blast across my ceiling and dance to the music. Spiraling flashing fractals extend into infinity as my ceiling becomes a field of various color and shapes. In front of this are a bunch of wasps and dragonflies flying around. I curl up like a dead bug and feel my limbs go numb. Am I dying? Doesn't matter, the world looks cool. I can see the room starting to fold up on itself, withering like me, the insects become more agitated and fly around faster. I unfold my limbs and feeling rushes back. The fractals in my ceiling become more colorful and begin to flash more excitedly and the insects fade away. I stand up and return to the computer. T1:20-I'm starting to feel very hot and sweaty. It feels like a large warm wet animal is draped over me. I stand in front of my ac for a bit and feel the tingling cold breeze on my skin and it goes away. At this point I feel extremely happy and optimistic and have an elated sense of self worth, believing myself to be some sage or philosopher or some shit. I begin lecturing people on the internet about the power of positive thinking and happiness and I honestly can do nothing but smile. Things are still flashing and making ghost images and such. I've taken to just making inane observations and shouting them at people like they are grand epiphanies. T1:30-I try playing Chivalry:Medieval warfare. It's extremely difficult. I give up pretty quickly. T1:35-Visuals aren't as overwhelming anymore but are strong and consistent. There is really nothing new to report. For the next few hours, I am in pretty much the same state. The visuals are all the same and are of the same strength, as are the though processes and feeling of being high. Same fractals, same breathing, same vibrating, same pulsating, same lights and flashes and colors. T2:20-I decide to go to the bathroom to get my cat. The bathroom tiles are all look like mirror images of themselves and are breathing and pulsing colors and faces which was pretty cool. Being in a new environment was nice and changed the nature of the hallucinations. I grab my cat and return to my room. He is soft and his fur is swirling and warping. I go on webcam with someone. my face is warping and shifting in proportions, like I'm looking at myself in a funhouse mirror. T3:30-The peak is coming to an end. The visuals are becoming milder but I am in the same mental state. Nothing really special to note. T5:00-Starting to pick up again oddly enough. The clouds outside are forming into clumps of letters, but I can't read them. Things are still breathing and swirling and warping, no more colors or fractals though. T7:00-Clouds are beginning to return to normal, warping and swirling and shifts in proportion slowing down too. I try to sleep, its hopeless. Teeth grinding is very strong at this point and very annoying, as is the sweating. T8:00-Finally manage to fall asleep. Trip can be considered officially over.

Experience:300mg 1P-LSD + 40mg diphenidine - My first psychotic break,"My cousin and I went to his flat after having some friends at mine. He just moved in, so a lot of stuff is still in boxes, on the floor or on the table. We cleared the table to play Power Grid and started smoking some weed and diphenidine. After roughly an hour and a half we decide to take some 1P-LSD. I go to his bedroom and lay in bed, while I put 3 tabs in my mouth. After some 15 minutes, the paper is losing its consistency and I go to the kitchen for a glass of soy milk to help swallow the tabs. I sit at the table but quickly decided that it was going to be too difficult to continue playing. So I go back to the bedroom and lay in bed again. I close my eyes and there's a lot of beautiful closed-eye visuals. With the open eye I can see strong tracers and a well-defined, although flat, floating geometry. After that, I just drift into my inner world, closing my eyes for most of the time and opening them very rarely just to check that my cousin was there enjoying the trip as well. Things get a bit confusing. I start feeling a lot of different sensations, all past sensations I think, on all sensory input channels (sounds, touch, shapes, colors, temperature, position, light, emotions, ...) I open my eyes and check on my cousin; and I feel grateful for sharing this experience with him. I feel our life-long friendship is only deepened and strenghted by sharing the magic and sacred psychedelic experience that unfolds inside and around us. I think he's concious now of that thing that's always there, around us, that the psychedelic experience allows us to see. I close my eyes and come back to the non-stop flow of sensations. These sensations come back to me with a ""realisation"": that the more I experience one of them in that flow, more of that sensation I'd have in my life. They come in pairs, cold and hot, dark and light, and I have to choose. Contradictions start arising in my thought stream and it's very difficult to decide between them. One of them becomes particularly strong: to leave my home city or to stay. Every time I open my eyes I realise it's getting brighter and brighter, and I remember I told my mom I'd return her car by 10am. I ""see"" in a sort of dream that I'm driving to my parents' place. In this dream I somehow become sure that I'd die that day. That it's unstoppable. That everything is a film and the film got to start again. That somehow the end would be very painful, but I've got to go through it. That perhaps if I do the right thing at the end of the tape I could stop time going back to the 80's. That perhaps this time I got the knowledge needed to stop the cycle. The dream stops and I stand up and tell my cousin that I have to leave. He says there's no point and I agree and sit at the table. I say something like ""and yes and no, and wait and not"". While sitting, I decide I'd much rather stay, but my mind lets me know that that's not an option: I'm going to die today. (This is not the first nor the last time I decided I'd prefer to stay.) So I say ""I've got to leave"" and stand up again. My mind reminds me ""it'll get awful at the end"" and I understand that I'll have to struggle with my beloved cousin, one of the most important persons in my life and whom I love like a brother. I start looking for my sandals and keys, but I find none of them. I think my cousin tells me something to try to make me understand that I shouldn't leave. I ignore him and just leave the flat and call the lift. He comes and brings me back inside. I leave again and this time, when he's outside trying to bring me back, I close the door of his flat. So we are locked out (later he would have to call a locksmith to open the door). He decides it would be good to knock at the door of a neighbour. While my cousin waits for the neighbour to come to the door, I call the lift again. I get on and press to go the ground floor. My cousin sees me and blocks the door while he explains to the neighbour what happened. They both come downstairs with me. I get to my mom's car, not sure if I had to struggle with my cousin to get there or not. By this point I knew I didn't have the keys. I tell my cousin that I know I'm going to die that day and it's going to be awful. I also knew that I had to do something different ""this time"" to ""stop the cycle"". That at some point I would have to do something magical. Something that the rational world wouldn't allow. So I try to ""jump"" inside the car as if I could magically go through the car's door. Obviously, it didn't work and I hit my face and body in several parts. I'm giving up, I don't know what else to do or how I'm supposed to die. I sit on the floor next to the car in semi-lotus position, waiting for my death to come. I tell my cousin that I'm happy that I'll die next to him. Suddenly, another idea comes to my mind: maybe I could magically go through the parking lot's exit gate and just walk to my death. So I stand up and start running to the exit gate. They come after me and stop me. I think at this point I punch my cousin and the neighbour in the face. They keep saying things to try to calm me down. I sit in semi-lotus position again and start waiting for my death to come again. I feel like everything is going according to ""plan"", that is, according to the previous ""showing of the film"" due to a constant feeling of dejavu (since the beginning of the trip). I grab my cousin's hand and collapse as if I had just died. But of course I didn't. At this point the gatekeeper comes to help my cousin. I think then my cousin asks me if he should call an ambulance and I reply ""yes, I'm gonna die, call them"". ""Are you sure?"" he asks. ""Yes, it will happen"" I say. During this time that we are waiting for the ambulance I imagine how my death might occur: I imagine a car going out of the parking lot and crashing with my head. Then the newspapers saying that yet another idiot died on LSD. I wished I could do something about it, but fate had been already written for me. The car never came, but instead the ambulance and my family arrived at the same time. They put me on the stretcher and then get me on the ambulance. My mom comes with me. I was still sure that I had to do something different this time, so I started taking off the catheters that the paramedics were putting on my veins. I told my mom that I'd die and that it was going to be really difficult as I started crying. The last thing I remember is tearing up a blue plastic bed sheet. After that they probably sedated me into sleep. When I woke up I couldn't believe that my memories of the morning were real. It all seemed like part of a very strange nightmare. I checked if I wasn't maybe still dreaming and the whole story was a dream but it wasn't. My whole family was there in the hospital when I woke up, asking me a lot of questions. This is the account of what I remember and am able to put somewhere in the linear passing of time. Some other things I remember but don't know when exactly they happened.

Experience: 1 tab 1P-LSD (oral) - Finding myself within the forest,"Context: Me and a few of my friends had intended to go out in the woods tripping. A lot didn't go to plan because I'd had a breakup which I took badly, and drank for the start of the morning. For most of the day I had no way of getting the time. Only at a few moments when I bumped into people and asked. I had a couple of tabs that I have been saving, which I had intended to use on the Friday evening. The night before I had just had a breakup which, naturally, put me in quite a bad, self-destructive mood. We had planned to take the tabs at around 2pm, and trip throughout the night. As the morning arrived, I was quite angry and I had a double of rum to start it, followed by half a can while sat in the woods waiting for my friends. I suppose the small amount of alcohol was enough to convince me to take a tab there and then (9:30am), so I did. I walked through the woods to another frequent hangout spot, bumping into some of my buddies. I sat down, and it wasn't before long it kicked in. It seems like 30-40 minutes was all it would take for me to start feeling the effects. I was sat down at the time, then I laid back looking up at the tree above. I looked at how the branches continuously branched off. From here, I started to have this feeling of detachment. I felt more like a spectator among the group of my friends than actually one of them. Though I'd be included among conversation, I kept zoning out and not taking in anything that was being said. I felt hysterical, laughing at anything and everything. Around this time, someone was passing a joint around. All the anger that I had been feeling the night before and the morning had gone. I felt much happier once I came up, with no worries or cares. I was laid in the grass, sprawled out with the occasional position adjustment. Soon after, I was convinced by one of my 'buddies' to give them my other tab (which was intended for another friend who wasn't in.) It wasn't hard for the other person to convince me - I felt too happy and carefree to worry about the consequences of 'jibbing' off one of my other mates who it was intended for. After my other buddy took his tab (in exchange for the remnants of his weed, £3 in cash and £7 he would pay back the following week.) We then, as a group, moved further into the forest towards a shady tree that sat in front of a wall where a local road traveled past. We all sat down and chained off many cigarettes and we smoked the rest of our weed. The rest of the group had to return to college for lessons, but I didn't want to go there at all, so I remained, alone. The first few minutes were bliss, I was sat looking at how beautiful all the trees and leaves looked. I felt connected to nature, sat on the floor taking in the sun. The tree was quite old, and from looking at it, I could see the bark fall into an infinite pattern that kept getting smaller. The tree, to me, also looked like it was a sort of statue from the way the bark had bulges on. I continued to sit there. Must have been for over an hour or two. The bush I was looking straight at, looked back at me as if the leaves were sharp pincers (although retaining their texture and color.) It didn't bother me, but it started a thought train within my head. One that would make me think deeply into my annoyed situation. For a lot of this solitary time, I felt like both a psychiatrist and a patient. I was thinking about my problems in depth, but then providing myself with helpful solutions and ways to cope. Rather than the need to have a relationship, I started to think about my relationship with myself; how I can be independent and that I do not need another person to be happy. After getting bored from being sat alone for 2 hours, I got up and decided to walk to the original place I hungout with my friends. Nobody was there. I sat there and took the lovely view into account, feeling a lot happier about myself. My fellow tripping buddy showed up on the way to the spot by the tree and the wall. I shouted him over and he wandered through the field and sat down. ""The others are coming over you know."" He was referring to the group of friends we hung around with. We started to walk back to the spot by the tree on the wall. Although to get there you have to walk through the field which I was watching (which meant I would have seen my friends walk there) I doubted if I would have actually seen them, so we walked all the way there. We found nobody and returned to the spot by the tree. (Fast forwarding some time, I sat around for a lot longer, often moving towards the two spots. I was in the same mood watching the landscapes and the trees for quite a few hours of the trip.) The time was now 2:30 and I was sat by the tree in the field, where my two good friends show up to smoke before getting the bus home. I sat there with them, offering them my tobacco and skins in exchange for a turn in rotation. I was sensing something was wrong with my friend at this point. I was quite paranoid. Not that he was going to hurt me or cause me bother, but he was unwell and his voice sounded very panicked and hesitant. I sensed that something was off (though it wasn't, he actually was just unwell.) In my mind I was thinking something wasn't right. My paranoia increased (though I didn't show it). I felt like they were hiding something from me. I hadn't seen most of my college friends throughout the day, and my friend that I had intended to trip with had gotten pissed off that I tripped without him. The situation I was in felt like a 'lamb to the slaughter' type of situation. They were being so nice to me as if I was going to die in a moment. It started to feel that way too. I felt like after we smoked the last few doobies, I'd be led off to some sort of Caesar esq betrayal. From thinking about it, I realized that it doesn't matter. If I was going to die, I'd spent the last minutes with my friends smoking and having a good time. Of course, I didn't die, though the feeling that I might persisted throughout the whole evening. It was around 3:30pm. I decided to return to college to see if any of my friends were back there, and if they would want to hang out with me back at college. Nobody wanted to, so I waved off my friends and returned to the field to sit until the trip died down. I only stayed for around an hour this time, gazing at the beautiful scenery. I headed to the caravan (a place where my cousin and her boyfriend often hungout which was also on the other end of town). They weren't in. I realized that at this point I was hungry and thirsty, and I had the £3 on me. I headed towards the local shell garage, where I bumped into her boyfriend's brother. They were just hanging out, smoking before they were going in, so I asked if I could hang out for a while. I was only with them for about 10-15 minutes before they headed off. Back across town I walked to get back to the field. At this point I was feeling very sober, and I thought that I was slowly coming down off the drug. On my way walking, I got to some roads. As I started to cross one, the road felt tiny, but running across it felt like it took ages. I heard people shouting, but I still cannot understand if they were actually shouting at me for being stupid on the road, or my paranoid mind was hearing things which seemed more likely. I finally got back to the spot. I felt dreadful because I may have caused obstruction on the road, but I was still high as a kite. I wanted to get sober so I could return home with no worries. I sat there and tried to focus on relaxing and calming down. At this point, I had smoked all of the tobacco on me and I desperately needed a smoke. I picked up a few bingies off of the floor, and lit and toked them for what would seem like a pretty shoddy lasts off. I sat there and fixated again, meditating, relaxing. Bringing myself to a mellow point where I could free myself of any worry again. The cars driving by sounded very loud. As they drove past, even the sound started to feel distorted. Slower. I also started hearing sirens as I tried to calm myself. Then, after calming myself, I started to think about this 'relationship with myself' and how I can gain independence. My great conclusion was to move out of my parent's house. My idea remained with me the whole day, and I felt very happy that I had figured out what I wanted to do. I felt purpose. I moved from the spot by the tree back to the big field. While walking there, I came across this small dehydrated field mouse. I picked it up and started to care for it. I felt quite similar to this mouse. I was outside, alone with no food or water. I wrapped it up in my bandanna, hopefully it would cool it down on this warm day. I would continue to still be a bit paranoid by sitting there. I saw a man walk across the field, and it looked like he was pacing from one end to the other. At first I was skeptical, but it progressed. He looked strung out. At least, that's what I thought. I gave it a few minutes and he went away. It was around 5 or 6 now. The sun was setting. I felt more comfortable on the road now, and capable of travel once again. I got up and walked to the caravan again, bumping into my cousin's boyfriend's brother once again. I only hung with them for a minute before going to the caravan. There, my cousin's boyfriend was in. I sat with him for a good few hours, smoking. Before I knew it, it was 9pm. My cousin was going to go to the caravan, so I had to leave them both on their own. I walked around the local park and sat on a skate-park ramp for an hour. Although I was still tripping, I decided to return home. It was around 10pm and I felt confident enough that I could masquerade as being drunk, but also that it was late enough that I wouldn't be confronted by any family member. I got up to my bed, stripped off and I climb in. I felt very sluggish, but finally I felt like I was home. No feelings of doom. I felt relaxed and tired after a long day's trip. -- Morning after, I felt quite refreshed. Looking at my jacket, I have some sort of fecal matter on the back, most likely from laying in the field all day. My bandanna needs washing and I hope to god the field mouse wasn't diseased too. I now feel more at peace than I did before. I don't feel angry from my breakup. It feels like it has been one long journey. A quest to find one's self.
